The simplest Bevy app looks like this:\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\n\nfn main() {\n    App::new().run();\n}\n\nNice and simple right? Copy the code above into your main.rs file, then run:\ncargo run\n\nin your project folder. You will notice that ... nothing happens. This is because we haven't told our app to do anything yet! Apps are just empty shells capable of running our application logic. Let's add some logic to our App using Bevy ECS.\n","id":"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/apps/","title":"Apps"},"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/ecs/":{"body":"All app logic in Bevy uses the Entity Component System paradigm, which is often shortened to ECS. ECS is a software pattern that involves breaking your program up into Entities, Components, and Systems. Entities are unique \"things\" that are assigned groups of Components, which are then processed using Systems.\nFor example, one entity might have a Position and Velocity component, whereas another entity might have a Position and UI component. Systems are logic that runs on a specific set of component types. You might have a movement system that runs on all entities with a Position and Velocity component.\nThe ECS pattern encourages clean, decoupled designs by forcing you to break up your app data and logic into its core components. It also helps make your code faster by optimizing memory access patterns and making parallelism easier.\nBevy ECS\n#\n\nBevy ECS is Bevy's implementation of the ECS pattern. Unlike other Rust ECS implementations, which often require complex lifetimes, traits, builder patterns, or macros, Bevy ECS uses normal Rust datatypes for all of these concepts:\n\n\nComponents: Rust structs that implement the Component trait\n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct Position { x: f32, y: f32 }\n\n\n\nSystems: normal Rust functions\nfn print_position_system(query: Query&lt;&amp;Transform&gt;) {\n    for transform in &amp;query {\n        println!(\"position: {:?}\", transform.translation);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nEntities: a simple type containing a unique integer\nstruct Entity(u64);\n\n\n\nNow let's see how this works in practice!\nYour First System\n#\n\nPaste the following function into your main.rs file:\nfn hello_world() {\n    println!(\"hello world!\");\n}\n\nThis will be our first system. The only remaining step is to add it to our App!\nuse bevy::app::App;\n\nfn main() {\n    App::new()\n        .add_system(hello_world)\n        .run();\n}\n\nThe \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadd_system()\n\n function adds the system to your App's \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchedule\n\n, but we'll cover that more later.\nNow run your App again using cargo run. You should see hello world! printed once in your terminal.\nYour First Components\n#\n\nGreeting the whole world is great, but what if we want to greet specific people? In ECS, you would generally model people as entities with a set of components that define them. Let's start simple with a Person component.\nAdd this struct to your main.rs file:\n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct Person;\n\nBut what if we want our people to have a name? In a more traditional design, we might just tack on a name: String field to Person. But other entities might have names too! For example, dogs should probably also have a name. It often makes sense to break datatypes up in to small pieces to encourage code reuse. So let's make Name its own component:\n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct Name(String);\n\nWe can then add People to our \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n using a \"startup system\". Startup systems are just like normal systems, but they run exactly once, before all other systems, right when our app starts. Let's use \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommands\n\n to spawn some entities into our \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n:\nfn add_people(mut commands: Commands) {\n    commands.spawn((Person, Name(\"Elaina Proctor\".to_string())));\n    commands.spawn((Person, Name(\"Renzo Hume\".to_string())));\n    commands.spawn((Person, Name(\"Zayna Nieves\".to_string())));\n}\n\nNow register the startup system like this:\nfn main() {\n    App::new()\n        .add_startup_system(add_people)\n        .add_system(hello_world)\n        .run();\n}\n\nWe could run this App now and the add_people system would run first, followed by hello_world. But our new people don't have anything to do yet! Let's make a system that properly greets the new citizens of our \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n:\nfn greet_people(query: Query&lt;&amp;Name, With&lt;Person&gt;&gt;) {\n    for name in &amp;query {\n        println!(\"hello {}!\", name.0);\n    }\n}\n\nThe parameters we pass in to a \"system function\" define what data the system runs on. In this case, greet_people will run on all entities with the Person and Name component.\nYou can interpret the Query above as: \"iterate over every Name component for entities that also have a Person component\"\nNow we just register the system in our App:\nfn main() {\n    App::new()\n        .add_startup_system(add_people)\n        .add_system(hello_world)\n        .add_system(greet_people)\n        .run();\n}\n\nRunning our app will result in the following output:\nhello world!\nhello Elaina Proctor!\nhello Renzo Hume!\nhello Zayna Nieves!\n\nMarvelous!\nQuick Note: \"hello world!\" might show up in a different order than it does above. This is because systems run in parallel by default whenever possible.\n","id":"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/ecs/","title":"ECS"},"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/plugins/":{"body":"One of Bevy's core principles is modularity.

For this, Bevy provides a set of \"default plugins\".\nBevy's Default Plugins\n#\n\nLet's make our app more interesting by adding the \"default Bevy plugins\".\nadd_plugins(DefaultPlugins) adds the features most people expect from an engine, such as a 2D / 3D renderer, asset loading, a UI system, windows, and input.\nfn main() {\n    App::new()\n        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n        .add_startup_system(add_people)\n        .add_system(hello_world)\n        .add_system(greet_people)\n        .run();\n}\n\nOnce again run cargo run.\nYou should hopefully notice two things:\n\nA window should pop up. This is because we now have \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindowPlugin\n\n, which defines the window interface (but doesn't actually know how to make windows), and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWinitPlugin\n\n which uses the winit library to create a window using your OS's native window api.\nYour console is now full of \"hello\" messages: This is because \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefaultPlugins\n\n adds an \"event loop\" to our application. Our App's ECS Schedule now runs in a loop once per \"frame\". We will resolve the console spam in a moment.\n\nNote that add_plugins(DefaultPlugins) is equivalent to the following:\nfn main() {\n    App::new()\n        .add_plugin(CorePlugin::default())\n        .add_plugin(InputPlugin::default())\n        .add_plugin(WindowPlugin::default())\n        /* more plugins omitted for brevity */\n        .run();\n}\n\nYou are free to use whatever approach suits you!\nCreating your first plugin\n#\n\nFor better organization, let's move all of our \"hello\" logic to a plugin. To create a plugin we just need to implement the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlugin\n\n interface. Add the following code to your main.rs file:\npub struct HelloPlugin;\n\nimpl Plugin for HelloPlugin {\n    fn build(&amp;self, app: &amp;mut App) {\n        // add things to your app here\n    }\n}\n\nThen register the plugin in your App like this:\nfn main() {\n    App::new()\n        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n        .add_plugin(HelloPlugin)\n        .add_startup_system(add_people)\n        .add_system(hello_world)\n        .add_system(greet_people)\n        .run();\n}\n\nNow all that's left is to move our systems into HelloPlugin, which is just a matter of cut and paste. The app variable in our plugin's build() function is the same builder type we use in our main() function:\nimpl Plugin for HelloPlugin {\n    fn build(&amp;self, app: &amp;mut App) {\n        app.add_startup_system(add_people)\n            .add_system(hello_world)\n            .add_system(greet_people);\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    App::new()\n        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n        .add_plugin(HelloPlugin)\n        .run();\n}\n\nTry running the app again. It should do exactly what it did before. In the next section, we'll fix the \"hello\" spam using Resources.\n","id":"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/plugins/","title":"Plugins"},"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/resources/":{"body":"Entities and Components are great for representing complex, query-able groups of data. But most Apps will also require \"globally unique\" data of some kind. In Bevy ECS, we represent globally unique data using Resources.\nHere are some examples of data that could be encoded as Resources:\n\nElapsed Time\nAsset Collections (sounds, textures, meshes)\nRenderers\n\nTracking Time with Resources\n#\n\nLet's solve our App's \"hello spam\" problem by only printing \"hello\" once every two seconds. We'll do this by using the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime\n\n resource, which is automatically added to our App via add_plugins(DefaultPlugins).\nFor simplicity, remove the hello_world system from your App. This way we only need to adapt the greet_people system.\nResources are accessed in much the same way that we access components. You can access the Time resource in your system like this:\nfn greet_people(time: Res&lt;Time&gt;, query: Query&lt;&amp;Name, With&lt;Person&gt;&gt;) {\n    for name in &amp;query {\n        println!(\"hello {}!\", name.0);\n    }\n}\n\nRes and ResMut pointers provide read and write access (respectively) to resources.\nThe delta field on Time gives us the time that has passed since the last update. But in order to run our system once every two seconds, we must track the amount of time that has passed over a series of updates. To make this easier, Bevy provides the Timer type. Let's create a new Resource for our system to track elapsed time with a Timer:\n#[derive(Resource)]\nstruct GreetTimer(Timer);\n\nfn greet_people(\n    time: Res&lt;Time&gt;, mut timer: ResMut&lt;GreetTimer&gt;, query: Query&lt;&amp;Name, With&lt;Person&gt;&gt;) {\n    // update our timer with the time elapsed since the last update\n    // if that caused the timer to finish, we say hello to everyone\n    if timer.0.tick(time.delta()).just_finished() {\n        for name in &amp;query {\n            println!(\"hello {}!\", name.0);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nNow all that's left is adding a GreetTimer Resource to our HelloPlugin. Use TimerMode::Repeating to make the timer repeat.\nimpl Plugin for HelloPlugin {\n    fn build(&amp;self, app: &amp;mut App) {\n        app.insert_resource(GreetTimer(Timer::from_seconds(2.0, TimerMode::Repeating)))\n            .add_startup_system(add_people)\n            .add_system(greet_people);\n    }\n}\n\nNow cargo run the App. It should now greet people at a reasonable rate.\n","id":"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/resources/","title":"Resources"},"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/setup/":{"body":"I know you are itching to start making games, but we need to do a small amount of setup first.\nRust Setup\n#\n\nAll Bevy app and engine code is written in Rust. This means that before we begin, we need to set up our Rust development environment.\nInstalling Rust\n#\n\nBevy relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.\nAs a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is \"the latest stable release\" of Rust.\nInstall Rust by following the Rust Getting Started Guide.\nOnce this is done, you should have the rustc compiler and the cargo build system installed in your path.\nInstall OS dependencies\n#\n\nLinux\n#\n\nFollow the instructions at Linux Dependencies\nWindows\n#\n\n\nRun the Visual Studio 2019 build tools installer\nFor easy setup, select the Desktop development with C++ workload in the installer.\nFor a mimimal setup, follow these steps:\n\nIn the installer, navigate to Individual components\nSelect the latest MSVC for your architecture and version of Windows\nSelect the latest Windows SDK for your version of Windows\nSelect the C++ CMake tools for Windows component\nInstall the components\n\n\n\nMacOS\n#\n\nInstall the Xcode command line tools with xcode-select --install or the Xcode app\nCode Editor / IDE\n#\n\nYou can use any code editor you want, but we highly recommend one that has a rust-analyzer plugin. It's still in development, but it already provides top-tier autocomplete and code intelligence. Visual Studio Code has an officially supported rust-analyzer extension.\nRust Learning Resources\n#\n\nThe goal of this book is to learn Bevy, so it won't serve as a full Rust education. If you would like to learn more about the Rust language, check out the following resources:\n\nThe Rust Book: the best place to learn Rust from scratch\nRust by Example: learn Rust by working through live coding examples\n\nCreate a new Bevy Project\n#\n\nNow we are ready to set up a Bevy project! Bevy is just a normal Rust dependency. You can either add it to an existing Rust project or create a new one. For completeness we will assume you are starting from scratch.\nCreate a new Rust executable project\n#\n\nFirst, navigate to a folder where you want to create your new project. Then, run the following command to create a new folder containing our rust executable project:\ncargo new my_bevy_game\ncd my_bevy_game\n\nNow run cargo run to build and run your project. You should see Hello, world! printed to your terminal. Open the my_bevy_game folder in your code editor of choice and take some time to look through the files.\nmain.rs is the entry point of your program:\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello, world!\");\n}\n\nCargo.toml is your \"project file\". It contains metadata about your project such as its name, dependencies, and build configuration.\n[package]\nname = \"my_bevy_game\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nedition = \"2021\"\n\n[dependencies]\n\nAdd Bevy as a dependency\n#\n\nBevy is available as a library on crates.io, the official Rust package repository.\nThe easiest way to add it to your project is to use cargo add:\ncargo add bevy\n\nAlternatively, you can manually add it to your project's Cargo.toml like this:\n[package]\nname = \"my_bevy_game\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nedition = \"2021\" # this needs to be 2021, or you need to set \"resolver=2\"\n\n[dependencies]\nbevy = \"0.10\" # make sure this is the latest version\n\nMake sure to use the latest bevy crate version ().\nCargo Workspaces\n#\n\nIf you are using Cargo Workspaces, you will also need to add the resolver to your Cargo.toml file in the root directory:\n[workspace]\nresolver = \"2\" # Important! wgpu/Bevy needs this!\n\nCompile with Performance Optimizations\n#\n\nWhile it may not be an issue for simple projects, debug builds in Rust can be very slow - especially when you start using Bevy to make real games.\nIt's not uncommon for debug builds using the default configuration to take multiple minutes to load large 3D models, or for the framerate for simple scenes to drop to near-unplayable levels.\nFortunately, there is a simple fix, and we don't have to give up our fast iterative compiles! Add the following to your Cargo.toml:\n# Enable a small amount of optimization in debug mode\n[profile.dev]\nopt-level = 1\n\n# Enable high optimizations for dependencies (incl. Bevy), but not for our code:\n[profile.dev.package.\"*\"]\nopt-level = 3\n\nYou might think to simply develop in release mode instead, but we recommend against this as it can worsen the development experience by slowing down recompiles and disabling helpful debug symbols and assertions.\nEnable Fast Compiles (Optional)\n#\n\nBevy can be built just fine using default configuration on stable Rust. However for maximally fast iterative compiles, we recommend the following configuration:\n\n\nEnable Bevy's Dynamic Linking Feature: This is the most impactful compilation time decrease! If bevy is a dependency, you can compile the binary with the \"dynamic\" feature flag (enables dynamic linking). Note that right now, this doesn't work on Windows.\ncargo run --features bevy/dynamic_linking\n\nIf you don't want to add the --features bevy/dynamic_linking to each run, this flag can permanently be set via Cargo.toml:\n[dependencies]\nbevy = { version = \"0.10.0\", features = [\"dynamic_linking\"] }\n\nNOTE: Remember to revert this before releasing your game! Otherwise you will need to include libbevy_dylib alongside your game if you want it to run. If you remove the \"dynamic\" feature, your game executable can run standalone.\n\n\nLLD linker: The Rust compiler spends a lot of time in the \"link\" step. LLD is much faster at linking than the default Rust linker. To install LLD, find your OS below and run the given command:\n\n\nUbuntu: sudo apt-get install lld\n\n\nArch: sudo pacman -S lld\n\n\nWindows: Ensure you have the latest cargo-binutils\ncargo install -f cargo-binutils\nrustup component add llvm-tools-preview\n\n\n\nMacOS: You can follow these instructions to install lld manually or install llvm through brew which includes lld: brew install llvm\n\n\n\n\nAlternative - mold linker: mold is up to 5× (five times!) faster than LLD, but with a few caveats like limited platform support and occasional stability issues.  To install mold, find your OS below and run the given command:\n\n\nUbuntu: sudo apt-get install mold\n\n\nArch: sudo pacman -S mold\n\n\nWindows: mold does not yet support Windows. See this tracking issue for more information.\n\n\nMacOS: mold does not yet support MacOS. See this tracking issue for more information.\nYou will also need to add the following to your Cargo config at YOUR_WORKSPACE/.cargo/config.toml:\n[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]\nlinker = \"clang\"\nrustflags = [\"-C\", \"link-arg=-fuse-ld=/usr/bin/mold\"]\n\nNOTE: Disabling bevy/dynamic may improve the performance of this linker.\n\n\n\n\nNightly Rust Compiler: This gives access to the latest performance improvements and \"unstable\" optimizations\nCreate a rust-toolchain.toml file in the root of your project, next to Cargo.toml.\n[toolchain]\nchannel = \"nightly\"\n\nFor more information, see The rustup book: Overrides.\n\n\nGeneric Sharing: Allows crates to share monomorphized generic code instead of duplicating it. In some cases this allows us to \"precompile\" generic code so it doesn't affect iterative compiles. This is only available on nightly Rust.\n\n\nTo enable fast compiles, install the nightly rust compiler and LLD. Then copy the contents of this file to YOUR_WORKSPACE/.cargo/config.toml. For the project in this guide, that would be my_bevy_game/.cargo/config.toml.\nIf something went wrong, check out our troubleshooting section or ask for help on our Discord.\nBuild Bevy\n#\n\nNow run cargo run again. The Bevy dependencies should start building. This will take some time as you are essentially building an engine from scratch. You will only need to do a full rebuild once. Every build after this one will be fast!\nNow that we have our Bevy project set up, we're ready to start making our first Bevy app!\n","id":"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/setup/","title":"Setup"},"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/introduction/":{"body":"If you came here because you wanted to learn how to make 2D / 3D games, visualizations, user interfaces, or other graphical applications with Bevy ... you came to the right place!

The code is free and open-source because we believe developers should fully own their tools. Games are a huge part of our culture and humanity is investing millions of hours into the development of games. Why are we continuing to build up the ecosystems of closed-source monopolies that take cuts of our sales and deny us visibility into the tech we use daily? We believe that the developer community can do so much better.\nFor a more in-depth introduction, check out the Introducing Bevy blog post.\n\n    Stability Warning\n\nBevy is still in the early stages of development. Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse. A new version of Bevy containing breaking changes to the API is released approximately once every 3 months. We provide migration guides, but we can't guarantee migrations will always be easy. Use only if you are willing to work in this environment.\nIf you are currently trying to pick an engine for your Next Big Project™, we recommend that you check out Godot Engine. It is currently much more feature-complete and stable. And it is also free, open-source, and scriptable with Rust!\nThis official book is still very incomplete. It will help you get started with the setup and learning the basics, but it does not yet cover most of Bevy's features.

Remove these parameters from all calls to these functions.\n// 0.7\nfn parallel_system(\n   task_pool: Res&lt;ComputeTaskPool&gt;,\n   query: Query&lt;&amp;MyComponent&gt;,\n) {\n   query.par_for_each(&amp;task_pool, 32, |comp| {\n        // ...\n   });\n}\n\n// 0.8\nfn parallel_system(query: Query&lt;&amp;MyComponent&gt;) {\n   query.par_for_each(32, |comp| {\n        // ...\n   });\n}\n\nIf using Query or QueryState outside of a system run by the scheduler, you may need to manually configure and initialize a ComputeTaskPool as a resource in the World.\nFail to compile on 16-bit platforms\n#\n\nbevy_ecs will now explicitly fail to compile on 16-bit platforms, because it is unsound on those platforms due to various internal assumptions.\nThere is currently no alternative, but we're open to adding support.\nPlease file an issue to help detail your use case.\nEnforce type safe usage of Assets::get\n#\n\nAssets::&lt;T&gt;::get and Assets::&lt;T&gt;::get_mut now require that the passed handles are Handle&lt;T&gt;, improving the type safety of handles. If you were previously passing in:\n\na HandleId, use &amp;Handle::weak(id) instead, to create a weak handle. You may have been able to store a type safe Handle instead.\na HandleUntyped, use &amp;handle_untyped.typed_weak() to create a weak handle of the specified type. This is most likely to be the useful when using load_folder\na &amp;str or anything not previously mentioned: assets.get(&amp;assets.get_handle(\"asset/path.ron\"))\na Handle&lt;U&gt; of  of a different type, consider whether this is the correct handle type to store. If it is (i.e. the same handle id is used for multiple different Asset types) use Handle::weak(handle.id) to cast to a different type.\n\nAllow higher order systems\n#\n\nSystemParamFunction has changed. It was not previously part of the public API, so no migration instructions are provided. (It is now included in the public API, although you still should not implement this trait for your own types).\nIf possible, any custom System implementations should be migrated to use higher order systems, which are significantly less error-prone.\nResearch is needed into allowing this to work for more cases.\nAdded offset parameter to TextureAtlas::from_grid_with_padding\n#\n\nCalls to TextureAtlas::from_grid_with_padding should be modified to include a new parameter, which can be set to Vec2::ZERO to retain old behaviour.\n// 0.7\nfrom_grid_with_padding(texture, tile_size, columns, rows, padding)\n\n// 0.8\nfrom_grid_with_padding(texture, tile_size, columns, rows, padding, Vec2::ZERO)\n\nSplit mesh shader files\n#\n\nIn shaders for 3D meshes:\n\n#import bevy_pbr::mesh_view_bind_group -&gt; #import bevy_pbr::mesh_view_bindings\n#import bevy_pbr::mesh_struct -&gt; #import bevy_pbr::mesh_types\n\nNOTE: If you are using the mesh bind group at bind group index 2, you can remove those binding statements in your shader and just use #import bevy_pbr::mesh_bindings which itself imports the mesh types needed for the bindings.\n\n\n\nIn shaders for 2D meshes:\n\n#import bevy_sprite::mesh2d_view_bind_group -&gt; #import bevy_sprite::mesh2d_view_bindings\n#import bevy_sprite::mesh2d_struct -&gt; #import bevy_sprite::mesh2d_types\n\nNOTE: If you are using the mesh2d bind group at bind group index 2, you can remove those binding statements in your shader and just use #import bevy_sprite::mesh2d_bindings which itself imports the mesh2d types needed for the bindings.\n\n\n\nCamera Driven Viewports\n#\n\nCamera::projection_matrix is no longer a public field. Use the new Camera::projection_matrix() method instead:\n// 0.7\nlet projection = camera.projection_matrix;\n\n// 0.8\nlet projection = camera.projection_matrix();\n\nDiagnostics: meaningful error when graph node has wrong number of inputs\n#\n\nExhaustive matches on RenderGraphRunnerError will need to add a branch to handle the new MismatchedInputCount variant.\nMake Reflect safe to implement\n#\n\n\nReflect derives should not have to change anything\nManual reflect impls will need to remove the unsafe keyword, add any() implementations, and rename the old any and any_mut to as_any and as_mut_any.\nCalls to any/any_mut must be changed to as_any/as_mut_any\n\nMark mutable APIs under ECS storage as pub(crate)\n#\n\n\nIf you experienced any problems caused by this change, please create an issue explaining in detail what you were doing with those apis.\nAdd global init and get accessors for all newtyped TaskPools\n#\n\nThread pools don't need to be stored in a resource anymore since they are now stored globally. You can now use get() to access it.\n// 0.7\nfn spawn_tasks(thread_pool: Res&lt;AsyncComputeTaskPool&gt;) {\n    // Do something with thread_pool\n}\n\n// 0.8\nfn spawn_tasks() {\n    let thread_pool = AsyncComputeTaskPool::get();\n    // Do something with thread_pool\n}\n\nSimplify design for *Labels\n#\n\n\nAny previous use of Box&lt;dyn SystemLabel&gt; should be replaced with SystemLabelId.\nAsSystemLabel trait has been modified.\n\nNo more output generics.\nMethod as_system_label now returns SystemLabelId, removing an unnecessary level of indirection.\n\n\nIf you need a label that is determined at runtime, you can use Box::leak. Not recommended.\n\nMove get_short_name utility method from bevy_reflect into bevy_utils\n#\n\n\nadded bevy_utils::get_short_name, which strips the path from a type name for convenient display.\nremoved the TypeRegistry::get_short_name method. Use the function in bevy_utils instead.\n\nRemove dead SystemLabelMarker struct\n#\n\nThis struct had no internal use, docs, or intuitable external use.\nIt has been removed.\nAdd reflection for resources\n#\n\nRename ReflectComponent::add_component into ReflectComponent::insert_component.\nMake reflect_partial_eq return more accurate results\n#\n\nPreviously, all reflect_***_partial_eq helper methods returned Some(false) when the comparison could not be performed, which was misleading. They now return None when the comparison cannot be performed.\nMake RenderStage::Extract run on the render world\n#\n\nThe Extract RenderStage now runs on the render world (instead of the main world as before).\nYou must use the Extract SystemParam to access the main world during the extract phase. Extract takes a single type parameter, which is any system parameter (such as Res, Query etc.).\nIt will extract this from the main world.\nNote that Commands will not work correctly in Extract - it will currently silently do nothing.\n// 0.7\nfn extract_clouds(mut commands: Commands, clouds: Query&lt;Entity, With&lt;Cloud&gt;&gt;) {\n    for cloud in clouds.iter() {\n        commands.get_or_spawn(cloud).insert(Cloud);\n    }\n}\n\n// 0.8\nfn extract_clouds(mut commands: Commands, mut clouds: Extract&lt;Query&lt;Entity, With&lt;Cloud&gt;&gt;&gt;) {\n    for cloud in clouds.iter() {\n        commands.get_or_spawn(cloud).insert(Cloud);\n    }\n}\n\nYou can now also access resources from the render world using the normal system parameters during Extract:\nfn extract_assets(mut render_assets: ResMut&lt;MyAssets&gt;, source_assets: Extract&lt;Res&lt;MyAssets&gt;&gt;) {\n     *render_assets = source_assets.clone();\n}\n\nBecause extraction now runs in the render world, usage of Res&lt;RenderWorld&gt; in the main world, should be replaced with usage of Res&lt;MainWorld&gt; in the render world.\nPlease note that all existing extract systems need to be updated to match this new style; even if they currently compile they will not run as expected. A warning will be emitted on a best-effort basis if this is not met.\nImprove Gamepad DPad Button Detection\n#\n\nD-pad inputs can no longer be accessed as axes.\nAccess them as gamepad buttons instead.\nChange window position types from tuple to vec\n#\n\nChanged the following fields\n\nWindowCommand::SetWindowMode.resolution from (u32, u32) to UVec2\nWindowCommand::SetResolution.logical_resolution from (f32, f32) to Vec2\n\nFull documentation for bevy_asset\n#\n\nRename FileAssetIo::get_root_path to FileAssetIo::get_base_path\nFileAssetIo::root_path() is a getter for the root_path field, while FileAssetIo::get_root_path returned the parent directory of the asset root path, which was the executable's directory unless CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR was set. This change solves the ambiguity between the two methods.\nHierarchy commandization\n#\n\nThe Parent and Children component fields are now private.\n\nReplace parent.0 by parent.get()\nReplace children.0 with *children\nYou can't construct Children or Parent component anymore, you can use this as a stopgap measure, which may introduce a single frame delay\n\n#[derive(Component)]\npub struct MakeChildOf(pub Entity);\n\nfn add_parent(\n    mut commands: Commands,\n    orphans: Query&lt;(Entity, &amp;MakeChildOf)&gt;,\n) {\n    for (child, MakeChildOf(parent)) in &amp;orphans {\n        commands.entity(*parent).add_child(child);\n        commands.entity(child).remove::&lt;MakeChildOf&gt;();\n    }\n}\n\nRemove blanket Serialize + Deserialize requirement for Reflect on generic types\n#\n\n.register_type for generic types like Option&lt;T&gt;, Vec&lt;T&gt;, HashMap&lt;K, V&gt; will no longer insert ReflectSerialize and ReflectDeserialize type data. Instead you need to register it separately for concrete generic types like so:\n    .register_type::&lt;Option&lt;String&gt;&gt;()\n    .register_type_data::&lt;Option&lt;String&gt;, ReflectSerialize&gt;()\n    .register_type_data::&lt;Option&lt;String&gt;, ReflectDeserialize&gt;()\n\nLighter no default features\n#\n\nbevy_asset and bevy_scene are no longer enabled when no-default-features is used with the bevy dependency.\n\nCrates that use Bevy with no-default-features will need to add these features manually if they rely on them.\n\nbevy = { version = \"0.8\", default-features = false, features = [\n    \"bevy_asset\",\n    \"bevy_scene\",\n] }\n\nImprove ergonomics and reduce boilerplate around creating text elements\n#\n\nText::with_section was renamed to Text::from_section and no longer takes a TextAlignment as argument.\nUse with_alignment to set the alignment instead.\nAdd QueryState::get_single_unchecked_manual and its family\n#\n\nChange system::QuerySingleError to query::QuerySingleError\ntracing-tracy updated from 0.8.0 to 0.10.0\n#\n\nThe required tracy version when using the trace-tracy feature is now 0.8.1.\n","id":"https://bevyengine.org/learn/migration-guides/0.7-0.8/","title":"0.7 to 0.8"},"https://bevyengine.org/learn/migration-guides/0.8-0.9/":{"body":"Before migrating make sure to run rustup update\nBevy relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.

Now, play won’t have any effect if the requested animation is already playing.\nChange gamepad.rs tuples to normal structs\n#\n\nThe Gamepad, GamepadButton, GamepadAxis, GamepadEvent and GamepadEventRaw types are now normal structs instead of tuple structs and have a new() function. To migrate change every instantiation to use the new() function instead and use the appropriate field names instead of .0 and .1.\nAdd getters and setters for InputAxis and ButtonSettings\n#\n\nAxisSettings now has a new(), which may return an AxisSettingsError.\nAxisSettings fields made private; now must be accessed through getters and setters.

Any use of Table::capacity should now be Table::entity_capacity.\nMake Handle::&lt;T&gt; field id private, and replace with a getter\n#\n\nIf you were accessing the value handle.id, you can now do so with handle.id()\nAdd TimeUpdateStrategy resource for manual Time updating\n#\n\nChanges the value reported by time.delta() on startup.\nBefore it would be [0, 0, correct] and this PR changes it to be [0, \"approximately the time between the time_system and present_frame\", correct].\nAdd methods for silencing system-order ambiguity warnings\n#\n\nAmbiguity sets have been replaced with a simpler API.\n// These systems technically conflict, but we don't care which order they run in.\nfn jump_on_click(mouse: Res&lt;Input&lt;MouseButton&gt;&gt;, mut transforms: Query&lt;&amp;mut Transform&gt;) { ... }\nfn jump_on_spacebar(keys: Res&lt;Input&lt;KeyCode&gt;&gt;, mut transforms: Query&lt;&amp;mut Transform&gt;) { ... }\n\n// Old (Bevy 0.8)\n#[derive(AmbiguitySetLabel)]\nstruct JumpSystems;\n\napp\n  .add_system(jump_on_click.in_ambiguity_set(JumpSystems))\n  .add_system(jump_on_spacebar.in_ambiguity_set(JumpSystems));\n\n// New (Bevy 0.9)\napp\n  .add_system(jump_on_click.ambiguous_with(jump_on_spacebar))\n  .add_system(jump_on_spacebar);\n\n\nRemove unused DepthCalculation enum\n#\n\nRemove references to bevy_render::camera::DepthCalculation, such as use bevy_render::camera::DepthCalculation. Remove depth_calculation fields from Projections.\nMake raw_window_handle field in Window and ExtractedWindow an Option.\n#\n\nWindow::raw_window_handle() now returns Option&lt;RawWindowHandleWrapper&gt;.\nFix inconsistent children removal behavior\n#\n\n\nQueries with Changed&lt;Children&gt; will no longer match entities that had all of their children removed using remove_children.\nRemovedComponents&lt;Children&gt; will now contain entities that had all of their children removed using remove_children.\n\nEntity's “ID” should be named “index” instead\n#\n\nThe Entity::id() method was renamed to Entity::index().\nRemove ExactSizeIterator from QueryCombinationIter\n#\n\nlen is no longer implemented for QueryCombinationIter. You can get the same value with size_hint().0, but be aware that values exceeding usize::MAX will be returned as usize::MAX.\nQuery filter types must be ReadOnlyWorldQuery\n#\n\nQuery filter (F) generics are now bound by ReadOnlyWorldQuery, rather than WorldQuery. If for some reason you were requesting Query&lt;&amp;A, &amp;mut B&gt;, please use Query&lt;&amp;A, With&lt;B&gt;&gt; instead.\nAdd pop method for List trait.\n#\n\nAny custom type that implements the List trait will now need to implement the pop method.\nRemove an outdated workaround for impl Trait\n#\n\nThe methods Schedule::get_stage and get_stage_mut now accept impl StageLabel instead of &amp;dyn StageLabel.\nAdd a change detection bypass and manual control over change ticks\n#\n\nAdd the Inner associated type and new methods to any type that you’ve implemented DetectChanges for.\nMake internal struct ShaderData non-pub\n#\n\nRemoved ShaderData from the public API, which was only ever used internally. No public function was using it so there should be no need for any migration action.\nMake Children constructor pub(crate).\n#\n\nChildren::with() is now renamed Children::from_entities() and is now pub(crate)\nRename Handle::as_weak() to cast_weak()\n#\n\n\nRename Handle::as_weak uses to Handle::cast_weak\n\nThe method now properly sets the associated type uuid if the handle is a direct reference (e.g. not a reference to an AssetPath), so adjust you code accordingly if you relied on the previous behavior.\nRemove Sync bound from Local\n#\n\nAny code relying on Local&lt;T&gt; having T: Resource may have to be changed, but this is unlikely.\nAdd FromWorld bound to T in Local&lt;T&gt;\n#\n\nIt might be possible for references to Locals without T: FromWorld to exist, but these should be exceedingly rare and probably dead code. In the event that one of these is encountered, the easiest solutions are to delete the code or wrap the inner T in an Option to allow it to be default constructed to None.\nThis may also have other smaller implications (such as Debug representation), but serialization is probably the most prominent.\nSwap out num_cpus for std::thread::available_parallelism\n#\n\nbevy_tasks::logical_core_count and bevy_tasks::physical_core_count have been removed. logical_core_count has been replaced with bevy_tasks::available_parallelism, which works identically. If bevy_tasks::physical_core_count is required, the num_cpus crate can be used directly, as these two were just aliases for num_cpus APIs.\nChanged diagnostics from seconds to milliseconds\n#\n\nDiagnostics values are now in milliseconds. If you need seconds, simply divide it by 1000.0;\nAdd Exponential Moving Average into diagnostics\n#\n\nLogDiagnosticsPlugin now records the smoothed value rather than the raw value.\n\nFor diagnostics recorded less often than every 0.1 seconds, this change to defaults will have no visible effect.\nFor discrete diagnostics where this smoothing is not desirable, set a smoothing factor of 0 to disable smoothing.\nThe average of the recent history is still shown when available.\n\nNested spawns on scope\n#\n\nIf you were using explicit lifetimes and Passing Scope you’ll need to specify two lifetimes now.\n// 0.8\nfn scoped_function&lt;'scope&gt;(scope: &amp;mut Scope&lt;'scope, ()&gt;) {}\n\n// 0.9\nfn scoped_function&lt;'scope&gt;(scope: &amp;Scope&lt;'_, 'scope, ()&gt;) {}\n\nscope.spawn_local changed to scope.spawn_on_scope this should cover cases where you needed to run tasks on the local thread, but does not cover spawning Nonsend Futures. Spawning of NonSend futures on scope is no longer supported.\nExtract Resources into their own dedicated storage\n#\n\nResources have been moved to Resources under Storages in World. All code dependent on Archetype::unique_components(_mut) should access it via world.storages().resources() instead.\nAll APIs accessing the raw data of individual resources (mutable and read-only) have been removed as these APIs allowed for unsound unsafe code. All usages of these APIs should be changed to use World::{get, insert, remove}_resource.\nClean up Fetch code\n#\n\nChanged: Fetch::table_fetch and Fetch::archetype_fetch have been merged into a single Fetch::fetch function.\nRename ElementState to ButtonState\n#\n\nThe ElementState type received a rename and is now called ButtonState. To migrate you just have to change every occurrence of ElementState to ButtonState.\nFix incorrect and unnecessary normal-mapping code\n#\n\nprepare_normal from the bevy_pbr::pbr_functions shader import has been reworked.\nBefore:\n    pbr_input.world_normal = in.world_normal;\n\n    pbr_input.N = prepare_normal(\n        pbr_input.material.flags,\n        in.world_normal,\n#ifdef VERTEX_TANGENTS\n#ifdef STANDARDMATERIAL_NORMAL_MAP\n        in.world_tangent,\n#endif\n#endif\n        in.uv,\n        in.is_front,\n    );\n\nAfter:\n    pbr_input.world_normal = prepare_world_normal(\n        in.world_normal,\n        (material.flags &amp; STANDARD_MATERIAL_FLAGS_DOUBLE_SIDED_BIT) != 0u,\n        in.is_front,\n    );\n\n    pbr_input.N = apply_normal_mapping(\n        pbr_input.material.flags,\n        pbr_input.world_normal,\n#ifdef VERTEX_TANGENTS\n#ifdef STANDARDMATERIAL_NORMAL_MAP\n        in.world_tangent,\n#endif\n#endif\n        in.uv,\n    );\n\nScene serialization format improvements from #6354, #6345, and #5723\n#\n\n\nThe root of the scene is now a struct rather than a list\nComponents are now a map keyed by type name rather than a list\nType information is now omitted when possible, making scenes much more compact\n\nScenes serialized with Bevy 0.8 will need to be recreated, but it is possible to hand-edit scenes to match the new format.\nHere's an example scene in the old and new format:\n// Old (Bevy 0.8)\n[\n  (\n    entity: 0,\n    components: [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"bevy_transform::components::transform::Transform\",\n        \"struct\": {\n          \"translation\": {\n            \"type\": \"glam::vec3::Vec3\",\n            \"value\": (0.0, 0.0, 0.0),\n          },\n          \"rotation\": {\n            \"type\": \"glam::quat::Quat\",\n            \"value\": (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0),\n          },\n          \"scale\": {\n            \"type\": \"glam::vec3::Vec3\",\n            \"value\": (1.0, 1.0, 1.0),\n          },\n        },\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"scene::ComponentB\",\n        \"struct\": {\n          \"value\": {\n            \"type\": \"alloc::string::String\",\n            \"value\": \"hello\",\n          },\n        },\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"scene::ComponentA\",\n        \"struct\": {\n          \"x\": {\n            \"type\": \"f32\",\n            \"value\": 1.0,\n          },\n          \"y\": {\n            \"type\": \"f32\",\n            \"value\": 2.0,\n          },\n        },\n      },\n    ],\n  ),\n  (\n    entity: 1,\n    components: [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"scene::ComponentA\",\n        \"struct\": {\n          \"x\": {\n            \"type\": \"f32\",\n            \"value\": 3.0,\n          },\n          \"y\": {\n            \"type\": \"f32\",\n            \"value\": 4.0,\n          },\n        },\n      },\n    ],\n  ),\n]\n\n// New (Bevy 0.9)\n(\n  entities: {\n    0: (\n      components: {\n        \"bevy_transform::components::transform::Transform\": (\n          translation: (\n            x: 0.0,\n            y: 0.0,\n            z: 0.0\n          ),\n          rotation: (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0),\n          scale: (\n            x: 1.0,\n            y: 1.0,\n            z: 1.0\n          ),\n        ),\n        \"scene::ComponentB\": (\n          value: \"hello\",\n        ),\n        \"scene::ComponentA\": (\n          x: 1.0,\n          y: 2.0,\n        ),\n      },\n    ),\n    1: (\n      components: {\n        \"scene::ComponentA\": (\n          x: 3.0,\n          y: 4.0,\n        ),\n      },\n    ),\n  }\n)\n\nDerive Reflect + FromReflect for input types\n#\n\n\nInput&lt;T&gt; now implements Reflect via #[reflect] instead of #[reflect_value]. This means it now exposes its private fields via the Reflect trait rather than being treated as a value type. For code that relies on the Input&lt;T&gt; struct being treated as a value type by reflection, it is still possible to wrap the Input&lt;T&gt; type with a wrapper struct and apply #[reflect_value] to it.\nAs a reminder, private fields exposed via reflection are not subject to any stability guarantees.\n\nRelax bounds on Option&lt;T&gt;\n#\n\nIf using Option&lt;T&gt; with Bevy’s reflection API, T now needs to implement FromReflect rather than just Clone. This can be achieved easily by simply deriving FromReflect:\n\n// OLD\n#[derive(Reflect, Clone)]\nstruct Foo;\n\nlet reflected: Box&lt;dyn Reflect&gt; = Box::new(Some(Foo));\n\n// NEW\n#[derive(Reflect, FromReflect)]\nstruct Foo;\n\nlet reflected: Box&lt;dyn Reflect&gt; = Box::new(Some(Foo));\n\nNote: You can still derive Clone, but it’s not required in order to compile.\nRemove ReflectMut in favor of Mut&lt;dyn Reflect&gt;\n#\n\n\nrelax T: ?Sized bound in Mut&lt;T&gt;\nreplace all instances of ReflectMut with Mut&lt;dyn Reflect&gt;\n\nremove blanket Serialize + Deserialize requirement for Reflect on generic types\n#\n\n.register_type for generic types like Option&lt;T&gt;, Vec&lt;T&gt;, HashMap&lt;K, V&gt; will no longer insert ReflectSerialize and ReflectDeserialize type data. Instead you need to register it separately for concrete generic types like so:\n  .register_type::&lt;Option&lt;String&gt;&gt;()\n  .register_type_data::&lt;Option&lt;String&gt;, ReflectSerialize&gt;()\n  .register_type_data::&lt;Option&lt;String&gt;, ReflectDeserialize&gt;()\n\nUtility methods for Val\n#\n\nIt is no longer possible to use the +, +=, -, or -= operators with Val or Size.\nUse the new try_add and try_sub methods instead and perform operations on Size's height and width fields separately.\nAllow passing glam vector types as vertex attributes\n#\n\nImplementations of From&lt;Vec&lt;[u16; 4]&gt;&gt; and From&lt;Vec&lt;[u8; 4]&gt;&gt; for VertexAttributeValues have been removed.\nI you're passing either Vec&lt;[u16; 4]&gt; or Vec&lt;[u8; 4]&gt; into Mesh::insert_attribute it will now require wrapping it with right the VertexAttributeValues enum variant.\n","id":"https://bevyengine.org/learn/migration-guides/0.8-0.9/","title":"0.8 to 0.9"},"https://bevyengine.org/learn/migration-guides/0.9-0.10/":{"body":"Bevy relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.\nAs a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is \"the latest stable release\" of Rust.\n\nMigrate engine to Schedule v3 (stageless)\n#\n\n\n    Rendering\n    ECS\n\n\n\nCalls to .label(MyLabel) should be replaced with .in_set(MySet)\n\n\nSystemLabel derives should be replaced with SystemSet. You will also need to add the Debug, PartialEq, Eq, and Hash traits to satisfy the new trait bounds.\n\n\nStages have been removed. Replace these with system sets, and then add command flushes using the apply_system_buffers exclusive system where needed.\n\n\nThe CoreStage, StartupStage, RenderStage, and AssetStage enums have been replaced with CoreSet, StartupSet, RenderSet and AssetSet. The same scheduling guarantees have been preserved.\n\n\nwith_run_criteria has been renamed to run_if. Run criteria have been renamed to run conditions for clarity, and should now simply return a bool instead of schedule::ShouldRun.\n\n\nLooping run criteria and state stacks have been removed. Use an exclusive system that runs a schedule if you need this level of control over system control flow.\n\n\nApp::add_state now takes 0 arguments: the starting state is set based on the Default impl.\n\n\nInstead of creating SystemSet containers for systems that run in stages, use my_system.in_schedule(OnEnter(State::Variant)) or its OnExit sibling.\n\n\nFor app-level control flow over which schedules get run when (such as for rollback networking), create your own schedule and insert it under the CoreSchedule::Outer label.\n\n\nFixed timesteps are now evaluated in a schedule, rather than controlled via run criteria. The run_fixed_timestep system runs this schedule between CoreSet::First and CoreSet::PreUpdate by default.\n\n\nCommand flush points introduced by AssetStage have been removed. If you were relying on these, add them back manually.\n\n\nThe calculate_bounds system, with the CalculateBounds label, is now in CoreSet::Update, rather than in CoreSet::PostUpdate before commands are applied. You may need to order your movement systems to occur before this system in order to avoid system order ambiguities in culling behavior.\n\n\nThe RenderLabel AppLabel was renamed to RenderApp for clarity\n\n\nWhen testing systems or otherwise running them in a headless fashion, simply construct and run a schedule using Schedule::new() and World::run_schedule rather than constructing stages\n\n\nStates have been dramatically simplified: there is no longer a “state stack”.

CoreSchedule::FixedTimestep is intended to be used for determinism and stability during networks, physics and game mechanics.\nUnlike timers, it will run repeatedly if more than a single period of time has elapsed since it was last run.\nIt is not intended to serve as a looping timer to regularly perform work or poll.\nIf you were relying on multiple FixedTimestep run criteria with distinct periods, you should swap to using timers, via the on_timer(MY_PERIOD) or on_fixed_timer(MY_PERIOD) run conditions.\nBefore:\napp.add_system_set(\n    SystemSet::new()\n        .with_run_criteria(FixedTimestep::step(0.5))\n        .with_system(update_pathfinding),\n)\n.add_system_set(\n    SystemSet::new()\n        .with_run_criteria(FixedTimestep::step(0.1))\n        .with_system(apply_damage_over_time),\n);\n\nAfter:\napp\n.add_system(update_pathfinding.run_if(on_timer(Duration::from_secs_f32(0.5))))\n.add_system(apply_damage_over_time.run_if(on_timer(Duration::from_secs_f32(0.1))));\n\nStates\n#\n\nStates have been significantly simplied and no longer have a state stack. Each state type (usually an enum), requires the States trait, typically implemented via the derive macro.\nFor example:\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, Default, Eq, PartialEq, Hash, States)]\nenum AppState {\n    #[default]\n    Menu,\n    InGame,\n}\n\nApp::add_state no longer takes an argument: the starting state is now controlled via the Default impl for your state type.\nTo access the current state of the the States type above, use Res&lt;State&lt;AppState&gt;, and access the tuple field via .0.\nTo queue up a state transition, use ResMut&lt;NextState&lt;AppState&gt;&gt; and call .set(AppState::Menu).\nState transitions are now applied via the apply_state_transitions exclusive system, a copy of which is added CoreSet::StateTransitions when you call App::add_state. You can add more copies as needed, specific to the state being applied.\nOnEnter and OnExit systems now live in schedules, run on the World via the apply_state_transitions system.\nBy contrast, OnUpdate is now a system set which is nested within CoreSet::Update.\nBefore:\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, Eq, PartialEq, Hash)]\nenum AppState {\n    Menu,\n    InGame,\n}\n\napp.add_state(AppState::Menu)\n    .add_system_set(SystemSet::on_enter(AppState::Menu).with_system(setup_menu))\n    .add_system_set(SystemSet::on_update(AppState::Menu).with_system(menu))\n    .add_system_set(SystemSet::on_exit(AppState::Menu).with_system(cleanup_menu))\n\nAfter:\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, Default, Eq, PartialEq, Hash, States)]\nenum AppState {\n    #[default]\n    Menu,\n    InGame,\n}\n\napp.add_state::&lt;AppState&gt;()\n    .add_system(setup_menu.in_schedule(OnEnter(AppState::Menu)))\n    .add_system(menu.in_set(OnUpdate(AppState::Menu)))\n    .add_system(cleanup_menu.in_schedule(OnExit(AppState::Menu)));\n\nWhen you need to run your state-specific systems outside of CoreSet::Update, you can use the built-in in_state run condition.\nWindows as Entities\n#\n\n\n    Windowing\n\nReplace WindowDescriptor with Window.\nChange width and height fields into a WindowResolution, either by doing\nWindowResolution::new(width, height) // Explicitly\n// or using From&lt;_&gt; for tuples for convenience\n(1920., 1080.).into()\n\nReplace any WindowCommand code to just modify the Window’s fields directly  and creating/closing windows is now by spawning/despawning an entity with a Window component like so:\nlet window = commands.spawn(Window { ... }).id(); // open window\ncommands.entity(window).despawn(); // close window\n\nTo get a window, you now need to use a Query instead of a Res\n// 0.9\nfn count_pixels(windows: Res&lt;Windows&gt;) {\n    let Some(primary) = windows.get_primary() else {\n        return;\n    };\n    println!(\"{}\", primary.width() * primary.height());\n}\n\n// 0.10\nfn count_pixels(primary_query: Query&lt;&amp;Window, With&lt;PrimaryWindow&gt;&gt;) {\n    let Ok(primary) = primary_query.get_single() else {\n        return;\n    };\n    println!(\"{}\", primary.width() * primary.height());\n}\n\nMake the SystemParam derive macro more flexible\n#\n\n\n    ECS\n\nThe lifetime 's has been removed from EventWriter. Any code that explicitly specified the lifetimes for this type will need to be updated.\n// 0.9\n#[derive(SystemParam)]\nstruct MessageWriter&lt;'w, 's&gt; {\n    events: EventWriter&lt;'w, 's, Message&gt;,\n}\n\n// 0.10\n#[derive(SystemParam)]\nstruct MessageWriter&lt;'w&gt; {\n    events: EventWriter&lt;'w, Message&gt;,\n}\n\nBasic adaptive batching for parallel query iteration\n#\n\n\n    ECS\n\nThe batch_size parameter for Query(State)::par_for_each(_mut) has been removed.

Use World::archetypes to get a read-only reference to either of these types.\nLock down access to Entities\n#\n\n\n    ECS\n\nEntities’s Default implementation has been removed. You can fetch a reference to a World’s Entities via World::entities and World::entities_mut.\nEntities::alloc_at_without_replacement and AllocAtWithoutReplacement has been made private due to difficulty in using it properly outside of bevy_ecs. If you still need use of this API, please file an issue or check bevy_ecs is excessively public for more info.\nBorrow instead of consuming in EventReader::clear\n#\n\n\n    ECS\n\nEventReader::clear now takes a mutable reference instead of consuming the event reader. This means that clear now needs explicit mutable access to the reader variable, which previously could have been omitted in some cases:\n// Old (0.9)\nfn clear_events(reader: EventReader&lt;SomeEvent&gt;) {\n  reader.clear();\n}\n\n// New (0.10)\nfn clear_events(mut reader: EventReader&lt;SomeEvent&gt;) {\n  reader.clear();\n}\n\nNewtype ArchetypeRow and TableRow\n#\n\n\n    ECS\n\nArchetype indices and Table rows have been newtyped as ArchetypeRow and TableRow.\nRound out the untyped api s\n#\n\n\n    ECS\n\nMutUntyped::into_inner now marks things as changed.\nExtend EntityLocation with TableId and TableRow\n#\n\n\n    ECS\n\nA World can only hold a maximum of 232 - 1 archetypes and tables now.

You can check out our Quick Start Guide to try it today. It's free and open source forever! You can grab the full source code on GitHub. Check out Bevy Assets for a collection of community-developed plugins, games, and learning resources.\nTo update an existing Bevy App or Plugin to Bevy 0.10, check out our 0.9 to 0.10 Migration Guide.\nSince our last release a few months ago we've added a ton of new features, bug fixes, and quality of life tweaks, but here are some of the highlights:\n\n\nECS Schedule v3: Bevy now has much simpler, more flexible scheduling. Systems are now stored in a unified schedule, commands can be applied explicitly via apply_system_buffers, and a whole lot of quality of life and bug fixes.\nCascaded Shadow Maps: Higher quality shadow maps that cover larger distances, where the quality follows the camera.\nEnvironment Map Lighting: 360 degree ambient image based lighting that can cheaply and drastically improve the visual quality of a scene.\nDepth and Normal Prepass: Render depth and normal textures for a scene prior to the main pass, enabling new effects and (in some cases) improved performance. Shadow mapping uses the prepass shaders, which enables transparent textures to cast shadows.\nSmooth Skeletal Animation Transitions: Smoothly transition between two skeletal animations playing at the same time!\nImproved Android Support: Bevy now works out of the box on more Android devices (with a couple of caveats)\nRevamped Bloom: Bloom now looks better, is easier to control, and has fewer visual artifacts.\nDistance and Atmospheric Fog: Add depth and ambiance to your scene with 3D distance and atmospheric fog effects!\nStandardMaterial Blend Modes: Achieve a variety of interesting effects with more PBR material blend modes.\nMore Tonemapping Choices: Choose one of 7 popular tonemapping algorithms for your HDR scenes to achieve the visual style you are looking for.\nColor Grading: Control per-camera exposure, gamma, \"pre-tonemapping saturation\", and \"post-tonemapping saturation\".\nParallel Pipelined Rendering: App logic and render logic now run in parallel automatically, yielding significant performance wins.\nWindows as Entities: Windows are now represented as entities instead of resources, improving the user experience and unlocking new scenarios.\nRenderer Optimizations: We spent a ton of effort optimizing the renderer this cycle. Bevy's renderer is snappier than ever!\nECS Optimizations: Likewise, we've turbocharged many common ECS operations. Bevy apps get a nice speed boost!\n\nECS Schedule v3\n#\n\nauthors: @alice-i-cecile, @maniwani, @WrongShoe, @cart, @jakobhellermann, @JoJoJet, @geieredgar and a whole lot more \nThanks to the fantastic work of our ECS team, the hotly awaited \"stageless\" scheduling RFC has been implemented!\nSchedule v3 is the culmination of significant design and implementation work. Scheduling APIs are a central and defining part of the Bevy developer experience, so we had to be very thoughtful and meticulous about this next evolution of the API. In addition to the RFC PR, the initial implementation PR by @maniwani and the Bevy Engine internals port PR by @alice-i-cecile are great places to start if you would like a view into our process and rationale. As we all know, plans and implementations are two different things. Our final implementation is a bit different from the initial RFC (in a good way).\nThere are a ton of changes, but we've put a lot of care into ensuring the migration path for existing applications is relatively straightforward. Don't sweat it!\nLet's take a look at what shipped in 0.10!\nA Single Unified Schedule\n#\n\nHave you ever wanted to specify that system_a runs before system_b, only to be met with confusing warnings that system_b isn't found because it's in a different stage?\nNo more! All systems within a single Schedule are now stored in a single data structure with a global awareness of what's going on.\nThis simplifies our internal logic, makes your code more robust to refactoring, and allows plugin authors to specify high-level invariants (e.g. \"movement must occur before collision checking\") without locking themselves into an exact schedule location.\n\nThis diagram made with @jakobhellermann's bevy_mod_debugdump crate shows a simplified version of Bevy's default schedule.\nAdding Systems\n#\n\nSystems (which are just normal Rust functions!) are how you define game logic in Bevy ECS. With Schedule v3, you can add systems to your App just like you did in previous versions:\napp.add_system(gravity)\n\nHowever Schedule v3 has some new tricks up its sleeve! You can now add multiple systems at once:\napp.add_systems((apply_acceleration, apply_velocity))\n\nBy default, Bevy runs systems in parallel to each other. In previous versions of Bevy, you ordered systems like this:\napp\n    .add_system(walk.before(jump))\n    .add_system(jump)\n    .add_system(collide.after(jump))\n\nYou can still do that! But you can now compress this using add_systems:\n// much cleaner!\napp.add_systems((\n    walk.before(jump),\n    jump,\n    collide.after(jump),\n))\n\nbefore() and after() are definitely useful tools! However, thanks to the new chain() function, it is now much easier to run systems in a specific order:\n// This is equivalent to the previous example\napp.add_systems((walk, jump, collide).chain())\n\nchain() will run the systems in the order they were defined. Chaining also pairs with per-system configuration:\napp.add_systems((walk.after(input), jump, collide).chain())\n\nConfigurable System Sets\n#\n\nIn Schedule v3, the idea of the \"system set\" has been redefined to support more natural and flexible control over how systems are run and scheduled. The old \"system label\" concept has been combined with the \"set\" concept, resulting in one straightforward but powerful abstraction.\nSystemSets are named collections of systems that share system configuration across all of their members. Ordering systems relative to a SystemSet applies that ordering to all systems in that set, in addition to any configuration on each individual system.\nLet's jump right into what this would look like. You define SystemSets like this:\n#[derive(SystemSet, Debug, Hash, PartialEq, Eq, Clone)]\nenum PhysicsSet {\n    Movement,\n    CollisionDetection,\n}\n\nYou can add systems to sets by calling the in_set method:\napp.add_system(gravity.in_set(PhysicsSet::Movement))\n\nYou can combine this with the new system features mentioned above:\napp.add_systems(\n    (apply_acceleration, apply_velocity)\n        .chain()\n        .in_set(PhysicsSet::Movement)\n)\n\nSystems can belong to any number of sets:\napp.add_system(\n    move_player\n        .in_set(MoveSet::Player)\n        .in_set(PhysicsSet::Movement)\n)\n\nConfiguration is added to sets like this:\napp.configure_set(\n    // Run systems in the Movement set before systems in the CollisionDetection set\n    PhysicsSet::Movement.before(PhysicsSet::CollisionDetection)\n)\n\nSets can be nested inside other sets, which will cause them to inherit the configuration of their parent set:\napp.configure_set(MoveSet::Enemy.in_set(PhysicsSet::Movement))\n\nSets can be configured multiple times:\n// In PlayerPlugin:\napp.configure_set(MoveSet::Player.before(MoveSet::Enemy))\n\n// In PlayerTeleportPlugin\napp.configure_set(MoveSet::Player.after(PortalSet::Teleport))\n\nCrucially system configuration is strictly additive: you cannot remove rules added elsewhere. This is both an \"anti-spaghetti\" and \"plugin privacy\" consideration. When this rule is combined with Rust's robust type privacy rules, plugin authors can make careful decisions about which exact invariants need to be upheld, and reorganize code and systems internally without breaking consumers.\nConfiguration rules must be compatible with each other: any paradoxes (like a system set inside of itself, a system that must run both before and after a set, order cycles, etc) will result in a runtime panic with a helpful error message.\nDirectly Schedule Exclusive Systems\n#\n\n\"Exclusive systems\" are Systems that have mutable direct access to the entire ECS World. For this reason, they cannot be run in parallel with other Systems.\nSince Bevy's inception, Bevy devs have wanted to schedule exclusive systems (and flush commands) relative to normal systems.\nNow you can! Exclusive systems can now be scheduled and ordered like any other system.\napp\n    .add_system(ordinary_system)\n    // This works!\n    .add_system(exclusive_system.after(ordinary_system))\n\nThis is particularly powerful, as command flushes (which apply queued-up Commands added in systems to do things like spawn and despawn entities) are now simply performed in the apply_system_buffers exclusive system.\napp.add_systems(\n    (\n        // This system produces some commands\n        system_a,\n        // This will apply the queued commands from system_a\n        apply_system_buffers,\n        // This system will have access to the results of\n        // system_a's commands\n        system_b,\n    // This chain ensures the systems above run in the order\n    // they are defined\n    ).chain()\n)\n\nDo be careful with this pattern though: it's easy to quickly end up with many poorly ordered exclusive systems, creating bottlenecks and chaos.\nWhat will you do with this much power? We're keen to find out!\nManaging Complex Control Flow with Schedules\n#\n\nBut what if you want to do something weird with your Schedule? Something non-linear, branching, or looping. What should you reach for?\nIt turns out, Bevy already had a great tool for this: schedules that run inside of an exclusive system. The idea is pretty simple:\n\nConstruct a schedule, that stores whatever complex logic you want to run.\nStore that schedule inside of a resource.\nIn an exclusive system, perform any arbitrary Rust logic you want to decide if and how your schedule runs.\nTemporarily take the schedule out of the World, run it on the rest of the world to mutate both the schedule and the world, and then put it back in.\n\nWith the addition of the new Schedules resource and the world.run_schedule() API it's more ✨ ergonomic ✨ than ever.\n// A Schedule!\nlet mut my_schedule = Schedule::new();\nschedule.add_system(my_system);\n\n// A label for our new Schedule!\n#[derive(ScheduleLabel, Debug, Hash, PartialEq, Eq, Clone)]\nstruct MySchedule;\n\n// An exclusive system to run this schedule\nfn run_my_schedule(world: &amp;mut World) {\n    while very_complex_logic() {\n        world.run_schedule(MySchedule);\n    }\n}\n\n// Behold the ergonomics!\napp\n    .add_schedule(MySchedule, my_schedule)\n    .add_system(run_my_schedule);\n\nBevy uses this pattern for five rather different things in Bevy 0.10:\n\nStartup systems: these now live in their own schedule, which is run once at the start of the app.\nFixed timestep systems: another schedule?! The exclusive system that runs this schedule accumulates time, running a while loop that repeatedly runs CoreSchedule::FixedUpdate until all of the accumulated time has been spent.\nEntering and exiting states: a bonanza of schedules. Each collection of systems that runs logic to enter and exit a state variant is stored in its own schedule, which is called based on the change in state in the apply_state_transitions::&lt;S&gt; exclusive system.\nRendering: all rendering logic is stored in its own schedule to allow it to run asynchronously relative to gameplay logic.\nControlling the outermost loop: in order to handle the \"startup schedule first, then main schedule\" logic, we wrap it all up in a minimal overhead CoreSchedule::Outer and then run our schedules as the sole exclusive system there.\n\nFollow the breadcrumbs starting at CoreSchedule for more info.\nRun Conditions\n#\n\nSystems can have any number of run conditions, which are \"just\" systems that return a bool. If the bools returned by all of a system's run conditions are true, the system will run. Otherwise the system will be skipped for the current run of the schedule:\n// Let's make our own run condition\nfn game_win_condition(query: Query&lt;&amp;Player&gt;, score: Res&lt;Score&gt;) -&gt; bool {\n    let player = query.single();\n    player.is_alive() &amp;&amp; score.0 &gt; 9000\n}\n\napp.add_system(win_game.run_if(game_win_condition));\n\nRun conditions also have a number of \"combinator\" operations, thanks to @JoJoJet and @Shatur:\nThey can be negated with not():\napp.add_system(continue_game.run_if(not(game_win_condition)))\n\nThey can also be combined with and_then and or_else:\napp.add_system(move_player.run_if(is_alive.or_else(is_zombie)))\n\nBevy 0.10 is shipping with a lovely collection of built-in common run conditions. You can easily run systems if there are events to process, timers that elapsed, resources that changed, input state changes, states that changed, and more (thanks to @maniwani, @inodentry, @jakobhellermann, and @jabuwu).\nRun conditions can also serve as a lightweight optimization tool. Run conditions are evaluated on the main thread, and each run criteria is evaluated exactly once each schedule update, at the time of the first system in the set that relies on it. Systems disabled by run conditions don't spawn a task, which can add up across many systems. Like always though: benchmark!\nRun conditions have replaced the \"run criteria\" in previous versions of Bevy. We can finally get rid of the dreaded \"looping run criteria\"! ShouldRun::YesAndCheckAgain was not exactly straightforward to reason about, either for engine devs or users. It's always a bad sign when your bool-like enums have four possible values. If you crave more complex control flow: use the \"schedules in exclusive systems\" pattern in the section above. For the other 99% of use cases, enjoy the simpler bool-based run conditions!\nSimpler States\n#\n\nSchedule v3 adds a new, much simpler \"state system\". States allow you to easily configure different App logic to run based on the current \"state\" of the App.\nYou define States like this:\n#[derive(States, PartialEq, Eq, Debug, Clone, Hash, Default)]\nenum AppState {\n    #[default]\n    MainMenu,\n    InGame,\n}\n\nEach variant of the enum corresponds to a different state the App can be in.\nYou add States to your App like this:\napp.add_state::&lt;AppState&gt;()\n\nThis will setup your App to use the given state. It adds the State resource, which can be used to find the current state the App is in:\nfn check_state(state: Res&lt;State&lt;AppState&gt;&gt;) {\n    info!(\"We are in the {} state\", state.0);\n}\n\nAdditionally, add_state will create an OnUpdate set for each possible value, which you can then add your systems to. These sets run as part of the normal app update, but only when the app is in a given state:\napp\n    .add_systems(\n        (main_menu, start_game)\n            .in_set(OnUpdate(AppState::MainMenu))\n    )\n    .add_system(fun_gameplay.in_set(OnUpdate(AppState::InGame)));\n\nIt will also create OnEnter and OnExit schedules for each state, which will only run when transitioning from one state to another:\napp\n    .add_system(load_main_menu.in_schedule(OnEnter(AppState::MainMenu)))\n    .add_system(cleanup_main_menu.in_schedule(OnExit(AppState::MainMenu)))\n\nadd_state also adds the NextState resource, which can be used to queue a state change:\nfn start_game(\n    button_query: Query&lt;&amp;Interaction, With&lt;StartGameButton&gt;&gt;,\n    mut next_state: ResMut&lt;NextState&lt;AppState&gt;&gt;,\n){\n    if button_query.single() == Interaction::Pressed {\n        next_state.set(AppState::InGame);\n    }\n}\n\nThis replaces Bevy's previous state system, which was very hard to deal with. It had state stacks, elaborate queued transitions, and error handling (that most people just unwrapped). The state stack was very complex to learn, very prone to exasperating bugs, and mostly ignored.\nAs a result, in Bevy 0.10 states are now \"stackless\": only one queued state of each type at a time. After lots of alpha testing, we're reasonably confident that this shouldn't be too bad to migrate away from. If you were relying on the state stack, you have plenty of options:\n\nBuild the \"stack\" logic on top of the core state system\nSplit your state into multiple states, which capture orthogonal elements of your app's status\nBuild your own state stack abstraction using the same patterns as Bevy's first-party version. None of the new state logic is hard coded! If you build something, let the rest of the community know so you can collaborate!\n\nBase Sets: Getting Default Behavior Right\n#\n\nAn astute reader may point out that:\n\nBevy automatically runs its systems in parallel.\nThe order of systems is nondeterministic unless there is an explicit ordering relationship between them\nAll of the systems are now stored in a single Schedule object with no barriers between them\nSystems can belong to any number of system sets, each of which can add their own behavior\nBevy is a powerful engine with many internal systems.\n\nWon't this lead to utter chaos and tedious spaghetti-flavored work to resolve every last ordering ambiguity?\nMany users liked stages, they were helpful for understanding the structure of an App!\nWell, we're glad you asked, rhetorical skeptic. To reduce this chaos (and ease migration), Bevy 0.10 comes with a brand new collection of system sets provided by DefaultPlugins: CoreSet, StartupSet, and RenderSet. The similarity of their names to the old CoreStage, StartupStage, and RenderStage is not a coincidence. Much like stages, there are command flush points between each set, and existing systems have been migrated directly.\nSome parts of the stage-centric architecture were appealing: a clear high-level structure, coordination on flush points (to reduce excessive bottlenecks), and good default behavior.\nTo keep those bits (while excising the frustrating ones), we've introduced the concept of Base Sets (added by @cart). Base Sets are just normal SystemSets, except:\n\nEvery system can belong to at most one base set.\nSystems that do not specify a base set will be added to the default base set for the schedule (if the schedule has one).\n\n// You define base sets exactly like normal sets, with the\n// addition of the system_set(base) attribute\n#[derive(Debug, Hash, PartialEq, Eq, Clone, SystemSet)]\n#[system_set(base)]\nenum MyBaseSet {\n    Early,\n    Late,\n}\n\napp\n    // This ends up in CoreSet::Update by default\n    .add_system(no_explicit_base_set)\n    // You must use .in_base_set rather than .in_set for explicitness\n    // This is a high-impact decision!\n    .add_system(post_update.in_base_set(CoreSet::PostUpdate))\n    // Look, it works!\n    .add_system(custom_base_set.in_base_set(MyBaseSet::Early))\n    // Ordering your base sets relative to CoreSet is probably wise\n    .configure_set(MyBaseSet::Early.before(CoreSet::Update))\n    .configure_set(MyBaseSet::Late.after(CoreSet::Update));\n\nLet me tell you a story, set in a world without Base Sets:\n\nA new user adds the make_player_run system to their app.\nSometimes this system runs before input handling, leading to randomly dropped inputs. Sometimes it runs after rendering, leading to strange flickers.\nAfter much frustration, the user discovers that these are due to \"system execution order ambiguities\".\nThe user runs a specialized detection tool, digs into the source code of the engine, figures out what order their system should run in relative to the engine's system sets, and then continues on their merry way, doing this for each new system.\nBevy (or one of their third-party plugins) updates, breaking all of our poor users system ordering once again.\n\nThe clear problem this illustrates is that most gameplay systems should not need to know or care about \"internal systems\".\nWe've found that in practice, there are three broad classes of systems: gameplay logic (the majority of all end user systems), stuff that needs to happen before gameplay logic (like event cleanup and input handling), and stuff that needs to happen after gameplay logic (like rendering and audio).\nBy broadly ordering the schedule via Base Sets, Bevy apps can have good default behavior and clear high-level structure without compromising on the scheduling flexibility and explicitness that advanced users crave.\nLet us know how it works out for you!\nImproved System Ambiguity Detection\n#\n\nWhen multiple systems interact with an ECS resource in conflicting ways, but don't have an ordering constraint between them, we call this an \"ambiguity\". If your App has ambiguities, this can cause bugs. We've significantly improved our ambiguity reporting, which can be configured in the new ScheduleBuildSettings. Check out the docs for more info. If you haven't tried this out on your app yet: you should take a look!\nSingle Threaded Execution\n#\n\nYou can now easily switch a Schedule to single-threaded evaluation via the SingleThreadedExecutor for users who don't want or need parallelism.\nschedule.set_executor_kind(ExecutorKind::SingleThreaded);\n\nCascaded Shadow Maps\n#\n\nauthors: @danchia, Rob Swain (@superdump)\nBevy uses \"shadow maps\" to cast shadows for lights / objects. Previous versions of Bevy used a simple but limited shadow map implementation for directional light sources. For a given light, you would define the resolution of the shadow map and a manual \"view projection\" that would determine how the shadow is cast. This had a number of downsides:\n\nThe resolution of the shadow map was fixed. You had to choose something between \"cover a large area, but have a lower resolution\" and \"cover a smaller area, but have a higher resolution\".\nThe resolution didn't adapt to camera positioning. Shadows might look great in one position, but terrible in another position.\nThe \"shadow projection\" had to be manually defined. This made it hard and unapproachable to configure shadows to match a given scene.\n\nBevy 0.10 adds \"cascaded shadow maps\", which breaks up the camera's view frustum into a series of configurable \"cascades\", which each have their own shadow map. This enables shadows in the cascade \"close to the camera\" to be highly detailed, while allowing shadows \"far from the camera\" to cover a wider area with less detail. Because it uses the camera's view frustum to define the shadow projections, the shadow quality remains consistent as the camera moves through the scene. This also means that users don't need to manually configure shadow projections anymore. They are automatically calculated!\n\nNotice how the nearby shadows are highly detailed whereas the shadows in the distance become less detailed as they get farther away (which doesn't matter as much because they are far away).\nWhile shadow cascades solve important problems, they also introduce new ones. How many cascades should you use? What is the minimum and maximum distance from the camera where shadows should appear? How much overlap should there be between cascades? Be sure to dial in these parameters to fit your scenes.\nEnvironment Map Lighting\n#\n\nauthors: @JMS55\nEnvironment maps are a popular and computationally cheap way to significantly improve the quality of a scene's lighting. It uses a cube map texture to provide 360 degree lighting \"from all directions\". This is especially apparent for reflective surfaces, but it applies to all lit materials.\nThis is what the PBR material looks like without environment map lighting:\n\nAnd this is what the PBR material looks like with environment map lighting:\n\nFor scenes that need constant lighting (especially outdoor scenes), environment maps are a great solution. And because environment maps are arbitrary images, artists have a lot of control over the character of the scene's lighting.\nDepth and Normal Prepass\n#\n\nauthors: @icesentry, Rob Swain (@superdump), @robtfm, @JMS55\n\nThis effect uses the depth from the prepass to find the intersection between the ground and the force field\nBevy now has the ability to run a depth and/or normal prepass. This means the depth and normal textures will be generated in a render pass that runs before the main pass and can therefore be used during the main pass. This enables various special effects like Screen Space Ambient Occlusion, Temporal Anti Aliasing, and many more. These are currently being worked on and should be available in the next release of Bevy.\n\nIn the image on the right, green lines are edges detected in the normal texture and blue lines are edges detected in the depth texture\n\nThe depth and normal textures generated by the prepass\nUsing the prepass essentially means rendering everything twice. The prepass itself is much faster since it does a lot less work than the main pass. The result of the prepass can be used to reduce overdraw in the main pass, but if your scene didn't already suffer from overdraw then enabling the prepass will negatively affect performance.  There are many things that can be done to improve this and we will keep working towards this goal. Like with anything performance related, make sure to measure it for your use case and see if it helps or not.\nThe prepass is still very useful when working on special effects that require a depth or normal texture, so if you want to use it you can simply add the DepthPrepass or NormalPrepass components to your camera.\nShadow Mapping using Prepass Shaders\n#\n\nauthors: @geieredgar\nPreviously, the shader used for shadow mapping was hard-coded and had no knowledge of the material, only meshes. Now in Bevy 0.10, a Material's depth prepass shaders are used for shadow mapping. This means that the shaders used to do the shadow mapping for a Material are customizable!\nAs a bonus, the availability of Material information during shadow mapping means that we could instantly enable alpha mask shadows allowing foliage to cast shadows according to the alpha values in their texture rather than only based on their geometry.\n\nNVIDIA ORCA Emerald Square scene (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0) with alpha mask shadow support\nSmooth Skeletal Animation Transitions\n#\n\nauthors: @smessmer\nYou can now smoothly transition between two (or more) skeletal animations!\n\nCharacter model and animations are royalty free assets from Mixamo.\n\nWith the new play_with_transition method on the AnimationPlayer component, you can now specify a transition duration during which the new animation will be linearly blended with the currently playing animation, whose weight will decrease during that duration until it reaches 0.0.\n#[derive(Component, Default)]\nstruct ActionTimer(Timer);\n\n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct Animations {\n    run: Handle&lt;AnimationClip&gt;,\n    attack: Handle&lt;AnimationClip&gt;,\n}\n\nfn run_or_attack(\n    mut query: Query&lt;(&amp;mut AnimationPlayer, &amp;mut ActionTimer, &amp;Animations)&gt;,\n    keyboard_input: Res&lt;Input&lt;KeyCode&gt;&gt;,\n    animation_clips: Res&lt;Assets&lt;AnimationClip&gt;&gt;,\n    time: Res&lt;Time&gt;,\n) {\n    for (mut animation_player, mut timer, animations) in query.iter_mut() {\n        // Trigger the attack animation when pressing &lt;space&gt;\n        if keyboard_input.just_pressed(KeyCode::Space) {\n            let clip = animation_clips.get(&amp;animations.attack).unwrap();\n            // Set a timer for when to restart the run animation\n            timer.0 = Timer::new(\n                Duration::from_secs_f32(clip.duration() - 0.5),\n                TimerMode::Once,\n            );\n            // Will transition over half a second to the attack animation\n            animation_player\n                .play_with_transition(animations.attack.clone(), Duration::from_secs_f32(0.5));\n        }\n        if timer.0.tick(time.delta()).just_finished() {\n            // Once the attack animation is finished, restart the run animation\n            animation_player\n                .play_with_transition(animations.run.clone(), Duration::from_secs_f32(0.5))\n                .repeat();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nImproved Android Support\n#\n\nauthors: @mockersf, @slyedoc\n\nBevy now runs out of the box on Android on more devices. This was unlocked by waiting for the Resumed event to create the window instead of doing it on startup, matching the onResume() callback on Android.\nTo follow the recommendations on the Suspended event, Bevy will now exit on receiving that event. This is a temporary solution until Bevy is able to recreate rendering resources when being resumed.\nPlease test on your devices and report successes or issues you may encounter! There is a known issue around touch position on some devices with software buttons, as winit doesn't expose (yet) the inset size, only the inner size.\nAs this brings Bevy closer to full support of Android, there isn't a need anymore for separate examples for Android and iOS. They have been regrouped in one \"mobile\" example, and the instructions updated (for Android and for iOS).\nHere is the same example running on iOS!\n\nRevamped Bloom\n#\n\nauthors: @StarLederer, @JMS55\nBloom has undergone some major changes and now looks better, is easier to control, and has fewer visual artifacts.\nIn combination with the new tonemapping options, bloom has been much improved since the previous release!\n\nIn Bevy 0.9, bloom looked like this.\nSwitching the tonemapper to something like AcesFitted is already a big improvement.\nIn Bevy 0.10, bloom now looks like this. It's much more controlled and less overbearing.\nTo make the bloom stronger, rather than raise the BloomSettings intensity,\nlet's double the emissive value of each cube.\nFinally, if you want more extreme bloom similar to the old algorithm, you can change\nBloomSettings::composite_mode from BloomCompositeMode::EnergyConserving to BloomCompositeMode::Additive.\nExplore the new bloom settings in an interactive playground using the new bloom_3d (and bloom_2d) examples.\n\n\n     \n        1\n        \n     \n     \n        2\n        \n     \n     \n        3\n        \n     \n     \n        4\n        \n     \n     \n        5\n        \n     \n     \n        6\n        \n     \n \nDistance and Atmospheric Fog\n#\n\nauthor: Marco Buono (@coreh)\nBevy can now render distance and atmospheric fog effects, bringing a heightened sense of depth and ambiance to your scenes by making objects appear dimmer the further away they are from view.\n\nFog is controllable per camera via the new FogSettings component. Special care has been put into exposing several knobs to give you full artistic control over the look of your fog, including the ability to fade the fog in and out by controlling the alpha channel of the fog color.\ncommands.spawn((\n    Camera3dBundle::default(),\n    FogSettings {\n        color: Color::rgba(0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 1.0),\n        falloff: FogFalloff::Linear { start: 50.0, end: 100.0 },\n    },\n));\n\nExactly how fog behaves with regard to distance is controlled via the FogFalloff enum. All of the “traditional” fog falloff modes from the fixed-function OpenGL 1.x / DirectX 7 days are supported:\nFogFalloff::Linear increases in intensity linearly from 0 to 1 between start and end parameters. (This example uses values of 0.8 and 2.2, respectively.)\n\n\n1\n1\n0\n2\n3\ndistance\nfog intensity\n\n\n\nstart\nend\n\nFogFalloff::Exponential increases according to an (inverse) exponential formula, controlled by a density parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\n0\n2\n3\ndensity = 2\ndensity = 1\ndensity = 0.5\ndistance\nfog intensity\n\nFogFalloff::ExponentialSquared grows according to a slightly modified (inverse) exponential square formula, also controlled by a density parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\n0\n2\n3\ndensity = 2\ndensity = 1\ndensity = 0.5\ndistance\nfog intensity\n\nAdditionally, a more sophisticated FogFalloff::Atmospheric mode is available which provides more physically accurate results by taking light extinction and inscattering into account separately.\nDirectionalLight influence is also supported for all fog modes via the directional_light_color and directional_light_exponent parameters, mimicking the light dispersion effect seen in sunny outdoor environments.\n\nSince directly controlling the non-linear fog falloff parameters “by hand” can be tricky to get right, a number of helper functions based on meteorological visibility are available, such as FogFalloff::from_visibility():\nFogSettings {\n    // objects retain visibility (&gt;= 5% contrast) for up to 15 units\n    falloff: FogFalloff::from_visibility(15.0),\n    ..default()\n}\n\nFog is applied “forward rendering-style” on the PBR fragment shader, instead of as a post-processing effect, which allows it to properly handle semi-transparent meshes.\nThe atmospheric fog implementation is largely based on this great article by Inigo Quilez, Shadertoy co-creator, and computer graphics legend. Thanks for the great write up and inspiration!\nStandardMaterial Blend Modes\n#\n\nauthor: Marco Buono (@coreh)\nThe AlphaMode enum has been extended in Bevy 0.10, bringing support for additive and multiplicative blending to the StandardMaterial. These two blend modes are staples of the “classic” (non physically-based) computer graphics toolbelt, and are commonly used to achieve a variety of effects.\n\nDemo showcasing the use of blend modes to create stained glass and fire effects. (Source Code)\nAdditionally, support for semi-transparent textures with premultiplied alpha has been added, via a dedicated alpha mode.\nHere's a high-level overview of the new modes:\n\nAlphaMode::Add — Combines the colors of the fragments with the colors behind them in an additive process, (i.e. like light) producing brighter results. Useful for effects like fire, holograms, ghosts, lasers and other energy beams. Also known as Linear Dodge in graphics software.\nAlphaMode::Multiply —&nbsp;Combines the colors of the fragments with the colors behind them in a multiplicative process, (i.e. like pigments) producing darker results. Useful for effects approximating partial light transmission like stained glass, window tint film and some colored liquids.\nAlphaMode::Premultiplied — Behaves very similarly to AlphaMode::Blend, but assumes the color channels have premultiplied alpha. Can be used to avoid discolored “outline” artifacts that can occur when using plain alpha-blended textures, or to cleverly create materials that combine additive and regular alpha blending in a single texture, thanks to the fact that for otherwise constant RGB values, Premultiplied behaves more like Blend for alpha values closer to 1.0, and more like Add for alpha values closer to 0.0.\n\n\nNote: Meshes using the new blend modes are drawn on the existing Transparent3d render phase, and therefore the same z-sorting considerations/limitations from AlphaMode::Blend apply.\nMore Tonemapping Choices\n#\n\nauthors: @DGriffin91, @JMS55\nTonemapping is the process of transforming raw High Dynamic Range (HDR) information into actual \"screen colors\" using a \"display rendering transform\" (DRT). In previous versions of Bevy you had exactly two tonemapping options: Reinhard Luminance or none at all. In Bevy 0.10 we've added a ton of choices!\nNo Tonemapping\n#\n\nThis is generally not recommended as HDR lighting is not intended to be used as color.\n\nReinhard\n#\n\nA simple method that adapts to the color in a scene: r = color / (1.0 + color). Lots of hue shifting, brights don't desaturate naturally. Bright primaries and secondaries don't desaturate at all.\n\nReinhard Luminance\n#\n\nA popular method similar to normal Reinhard that incorporates luminance. It adapts to the amount of light in a scene. This is what we had in previous versions of Bevy. It is still our default algorithm, but this will likely change in the future. Hues shift. Brights don't desaturate much at all across the spectrum.\n\nACES Fitted\n#\n\nAn extremely popular algorithm used in film and industry (ex: ACES is the default Unreal tonemapping algorithm). When people say \"filmic\", this is often what they mean.\nNot neutral, has a very specific aesthetic, intentional and dramatic hue shifting.\nBright greens and reds turn orange. Bright blues turn magenta. Significantly increased contrast. Brights desaturate across the spectrum.\n\nAgX\n#\n\nVery neutral. Image is somewhat desaturated when compared to other transforms. Little to no hue shifting. Subtle Abney shifting. Created by Troy Sobotka\n\nSomewhat Boring Display Transform\n#\n\nHas little hue shifting in the darks and mids, but lots in the brights. Brights desaturate across the spectrum.\nIs sort of between Reinhard and Reinhard Luminance. Conceptually similar to reinhard-jodie.\nDesigned as a compromise if you want e.g. decent skin tones in low light, but can't afford to re-do your\nVFX to look good without hue shifting. Created by Tomasz Stachowiak.\n\nTonyMcMapface\n#\n\nVery neutral. Subtle but intentional hue shifting. Brights desaturate across the spectrum.\nFrom the author: Tony is a display transform intended for real-time applications such as games.\nIt is intentionally boring, does not increase contrast or saturation, and stays close to the\ninput stimulus where compression isn't necessary.\nBrightness-equivalent luminance of the input stimulus is compressed. The non-linearity resembles Reinhard.\nColor hues are preserved during compression, except for a deliberate Bezold–Brücke shift.\nTo avoid posterization, selective desaturation is employed, with care to avoid the Abney effect. Created by Tomasz Stachowiak\n\nBlender Filmic\n#\n\nDefault Filmic Display Transform from Blender. Somewhat neutral. Hues shift. Brights desaturate across the spectrum.\n\nColor Grading Control\n#\n\nauthors: @DGriffin91\nWe've added some basic control over color grading parameters such as exposure, gamma, \"pre-tonemapping saturation\", and \"post-tonemapping saturation\". These can be configured per camera using the new ColorGrading component.\n0.5 Exposure\n#\n\n\n2.25 Exposure\n#\n\n\nParallel Pipelined Rendering\n#\n\nauthors: @hymm, @james7132\n\nOn multithreaded platforms, Bevy 0.10 will now run significantly faster by running simulation and\nrendering in parallel. The renderer was rearchitected in Bevy 0.6\nto enable this, but the final step of actually running them in parallel was not done until now.\nThere was a bit of tricky work to figure out. The render world has a system that has to run on\nthe main thread, but the task pool only had the ability to run on the world's thread. So, when we send\nthe render world to another thread we need to accommodate still running render systems on the main\nthread. To accomplish this, we added the ability to spawn tasks onto the main thread in addition to the world's thread.\n\nIn testing different Bevy examples, the gains were typically in the 10% to 30% range.\nAs seen in the above histogram, the mean frame time of the \"many foxes\" stress test\nis 1.8ms faster than before.\nTo use pipelined rendering, you just need to add the PipelinedRenderingPlugin. If you're\nusing DefaultPlugins then it will automatically be added for you on all platforms except\nwasm. Bevy does not currently support multithreading on wasm which is needed for this\nfeature to work. If you are not using DefaultPlugins you can add the plugin manually.\nWindows as Entities\n#\n\nauthors: @aceeri, @Weibye, @cart\nIn previous versions of Bevy, Window was represented as an ECS resource (contained in the Windows resource). In Bevy 0.10 Window is now a component (and therefore windows are represented as entities).\nThis accomplishes a number of goals:\n\nIt opens the doors to representing Windows in Bevy's scene system\nIt exposes Windows to Bevy's powerful ECS queries\nIt provides granular per-window change detection\nImproves the readability/discoverability of creating, using, and closing windows\nChanging the properties of a window is the same for both initializing and modifying. No more WindowDescriptor fuss!\nIt allows Bevy developers and users to easily attach new component data to windows\n\nfn create_window(mut commands: Commands) {\n    commands.spawn(Window {\n        title: \"My window :D\".to_string(),\n        ..default()\n    });\n}\n\nfn modify_windows(mut windows: Query&lt;&amp;mut Window&gt;) {\n    for window in &amp;mut windows {\n        window.title = \"My changed window! :D\".to_string();\n    }\n}\n\nfn close_windows(mut commands: Commands, windows: Query&lt;Entity, With&lt;Window&gt;&gt;) {\n    for entity in &amp;windows {\n        commands.entity(entity).despawn();\n    }\n}\n\nRenderer Optimizations\n#\n\nauthors: @danchia, Rob Swain (@superdump), james7132, @kurtkuehnert, @robfm\nBevy's renderer was ripe for optimization. So we optimized it!\nThe biggest bottleneck when rendering anything in Bevy is the final render stage, where we collect all of the data in the render world to issue draw calls to the GPU. The core loops here are extremely hot and any extra overhead is noticeable. In Bevy 0.10, we've thrown the kitchen sink at this problem and have attacked it from every angle. Overall, these following optimizations should make the render stage 2-3 times faster than it was in 0.9:\n\nIn #7639 by @danchia, we found that even disabled logging has a strong impact on hot loops, netting us 20-50% speedups in the stage.\nIn #6944 by @james7132, we shrank the core data structures involved in the stage, reducing memory fetches and netting us 9% speedups.\nIn #6885 by @james7132, we rearchitected our PhaseItem and RenderCommand infrastructure to combine common operations when fetching component data from the World, netting us a 7% speedup.\nIn #7053 by @james7132, we changed TrackedRenderPass's allocation patterns to minimize branching within these loops, netting a 6% speedup.\nIn #7084 by @james7132, we altered how we're fetching resources from the World to minimize the use of atomics in the stage, netting a 2% speedup.\nIn #6988 by @kurtkuehnert, we changed our internal resource IDs to use atomically incremented counters instead of UUIDs, reducing the comparison cost of some of the branches in the stage.\n\nOne other ongoing development is enabling the render stage to properly parallelize command encoding across multiple threads. Following #7248 by @james7132, we now support ingesting externally created CommandBuffers into the render graph, which should allow users to encode GPU commands in parallel and import them into the render graph. This is currently blocked by wgpu, which locks the GPU device when encoding render passes, but we should be able to support parallel command encoding as soon as that's addressed.\nOn a similar note, we've made steps to enable higher parallelism in other stages of the rendering pipeline. PipelineCache has been a resource that almost every Queue stage system needed to access mutably, but also only rarely needed to be written to. In #7205, @danchia changed this to use internal mutability to allow for these systems to parallelize. This doesn't fully allow every system in this stage to parallelize just yet, as there still remain a few common blockers, but it should allow non-conflicting render phases to queue commands at the same time.\nOptimization isn't all about CPU time! We've also improved memory usage, compile times, and GPU performance as well!\n\nWe've also reduced the memory usage of ComputedVisibility by 50% thanks to @james7132. This was done by replacing the internal storage with a set of bitflags instead of multiple booleans.\n@robfm also used type erasure as a work-around a rustc performance regression to ensure that rendering related crates have better compile times, with some of the crates compiling up to 60% faster! Full details can be seen in #5950.\nIn #7069, Rob Swain (@superdump) reduced the number of active registers used on the GPU to prevent register spilling, significantly improving GPU-side performance.\n\nFinally, we have made some improvements on specific usage scenarios:\n\nIn #6833, @james7132 improved the extraction of bones for mesh skinning by 40-50% by omitting an unnecessary buffer copy.\nIn #7311, @james7132 improved UI extraction by 33% by lifting a common computation out of a hot loop.\n\nParallelized Transform Propagation and Animation Kinematics\n#\n\nauthors: @james7132\nTransform propagation is one of the core systems of any game engine. If you move a parent entity, you expect its children to move in worldspace. Bevy's transform propagation system happens to be one of the largest bottlenecks for multiple systems: rendering, UI, physics, animation, etc. cannot run until it's complete. It's imperative that transform propagation is fast to avoid blocking all of these systems. In Bevy 0.9 and before, transform propagation has always been single-threaded and always requires a full hierarchy traversal. As worlds got larger, so did the time spent in this key bottleneck. In Bevy 0.10, transform propagation leverages the structure of a well-formed hierarchy to fully run over multiple threads. The full performance benefits entirely depend on how the hierarchy is structured and how many CPU cores are available. In our testing, this has made transform propagation in our many_foxes benchmark 4 times faster on our testing hardware.\nIf transform propagation can be parallelized, so can forward kinematics for animation. We leveraged the same guaranteed structure of well formed hierarchies to fully parallelize playing skeletal animations. We also enabled a basic entity-path cache lookup to reduce the extra lookups the system was doing. Altogether, we were able to make the animation player system on the same many_foxes benchmark 10 times faster.\nCombined with all of the other optimizations seen in this release, our tests on the many_foxes benchmark has sped up from ~10ms per frame (~100 FPS) to ~2.3ms per frame (~434 FPS), a near 5x speedup!\nECS Optimizations\n#\n\nauthors: @james7132, @JoJoJet\nECS underlies the entire engine, so eliminating overhead in the ECS results in engine-wide speedups. In Bevy 0.10, we've found quite a few areas where we were able to massively reduce the overhead and improve CPU utilization for the entire engine.\nIn #6547, we enabled autovectorization when using Query::for_each, and its parallel variants. Depending on the target architecture the engine is being compiled for, this can result in a 50-87.5% speed up in query iteration time. In 0.11, we may be extending this optimization to all iterator combinators based on Iterator::fold, such as Iterator::count. See this PR for more details.\nIn #6681, by tightly packing entity location metadata and avoiding extra memory lookups, we've significantly reduced the overhead when making random query lookups via Query::get, seeing up to a 43% reduction in the overhead spent in Query::get and World::get.\nIn #6800 and #6902, we've found that rustc can optimize out compile-time constant branches across function boundaries, moving the branch from runtime to compile time, has resulted in up to a 50% reduction in overhead when using EntityRef::get, EntityMut::insert, EntityMut::remove, and their variants.\nIn #6391, we've reworked CommandQueue's internals to be more CPU-cache friendly, which has shown up to a 37% speedup when encoding and applying commands.\nSystemParam Improvements\n#\n\nauthors: @JoJoJet\nCentral to Bevy's ECS are SystemParams: these types, such as Query and Res, dictate what a system can and can't do.\nPreviously, manually creating one required implementing a family of four inseparable traits.\nIn Bevy 0.10, we've used generic associated types to reduce this to just two traits: SystemParam and ReadOnlySystemParam.\nAdditionally, the #[derive(SystemParam)] macro has received a host of miscellaneous usability improvements:\n\nMore Flexible: you are no longer forced to declare lifetimes you don't use. Tuple structs are now allowed, and const generics don't break things.\nEncapsulated: a long-standing bug has been fixed that leaked the types of private fields. Now, SystemParams can properly encapsulate private world data.\nLimitless: the 16-field limit has been lifted, so you can make your params as ridiculously complex as you want. This is most useful for generated code.\n\nDeferred World Mutations\n#\n\nauthors: @JoJoJet\nYou probably know that when you send a Command, it doesn't mutate the world right away. The command gets stored in the system and applied later on\nin the schedule. Deferring mutations in this way has a few benefits:\n\nMinimizing world accesses: unlike mutable queries (and resources), deferred mutations are free from data access conflicts, which affords greater parallelizability to systems using this pattern.\nOrder independence: when performing idempotent operations (like setting a global flag), deferred mutations allow you to not worry about system execution order.\nStructural mutations: deferred mutations are able to change the structure of the world in ways that Query and ResMut cannot, such as adding components or spawning and despawning entities.\n\nBevy 0.10 adds first-class support for this pattern via the Deferred system parameter, which accepts a SystemBuffer trait impl. This lets you create systems with custom deferred mutation behavior while skipping the overhead associated with Commands!\n/// Sends events with a delay, but can run in parallel with other event writers.\npub struct EventBuffer&lt;E&gt;(Vec&lt;E&gt;);\n\n// The `SystemBuffer` trait controls how deferred mutations get applied to the world.\nimpl&lt;E&gt; SystemBuffer for EventBuffer&lt;E&gt; { ... }\n\nfn my_system(mut events: Deferred&lt;EventBuffer&lt;MyEvent&gt;&gt;) {\n    // Queue up an event to get sent when commands are applied.\n    events.0.push(MyEvent);\n}\n\nNote that this feature should be used with care -- despite the potential performance benefits, inappropriate usage can actually worsen performance. Any time you perform an optimization, make sure you check that it actually speeds things up!\nRef&lt;T&gt; Queries\n#\n\nauthors: @Guvante, @JoJoJet\nSince Bevy 0.1, Mut&lt;T&gt; has been used to enable change detection (along with related types like ResMut&lt;T&gt;). It's a simple wrapper type that provides mutable access to a component alongside its change tick metadata, automatically marking a change when the value is mutated.\nIn Bevy 0.10, the change detection family has grown with Ref&lt;T&gt;, the immutable variant of Mut&lt;T&gt;. Like its mutable sibling, it allows you to react to changes made outside of the current system.\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\n\nfn inspect_changes_system&lt;T: Component + Debug&gt;(q: Query&lt;Ref&lt;T&gt;&gt;) {\n    // Iterate over each component of type `T` and log its changed status.\n    for val in &amp;q {\n        if val.is_changed() {\n            println!(\"Value `{val:?}` was last changed at tick {}.\", val.last_changed());\n        } else {\n            println!(\"Value `{val:?}` is unchanged.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWe are also deprecating ChangeTrackers&lt;T&gt;, which is the old way of inspecting a component's change ticks. This type will be removed in the next version of Bevy.\nCubic Curves\n#\n\nauthors: @aevyrie\n\nThis video shows four kinds of cubic curves being smoothly animated with bezier easing. The curve itself is white, green is velocity, red is acceleration, and blue are the control points that determine the shape of the curve.\nIn preparation for UI animation and hand-tweaked animation curves, cubic curves have been added to bevy_math. The implementation provides multiple curves out of the box, useful in various applications:\n\nBezier: user-drawn splines, and cubic-bezier animation easing for UI - helper methods are provided for cubic animation easing as demonstrated in the above video.\nHermite: smooth interpolation between two points in time where you know both the position and velocity, such as network prediction.\nCardinal: easy interpolation between any number of control points, automatically computing tangents; Catmull-Rom is a type of Cardinal spline.\nB-Spline: acceleration-continuous motion, particularly useful for camera paths where a smooth change in velocity (acceleration) is important to prevent harsh jerking motion.\n\nThe CubicGenerator trait is public, allowing you to define your own custom splines that generate CubicCurves!\nPerformance\n#\n\nThe position, velocity, and acceleration of a CubicCurve can be evaluated at any point. These evaluations all have the same performance cost, regardless of the type of cubic curve being used. On a modern CPU, these evaluations take 1-2 ns, and animation easing - which is an iterative process - takes 15-20 ns.\nAccessKit integration into bevy_ui\n#\n\nauthors: @ndarilek\nGames are for everyone: and the way they're built should reflect that.\nAccessible games are rare, and proper support is often an afterthought, both at an engine and a game level.\nBy building our UI solution with accessibility in mind, we hope to fix that.\nBevy has joined egui in making the first steps towards cross-platform accessibility-by-default, with the help of the outstanding AccessKit crate.\nTo our knowledge, this makes Bevy the first general purpose game engine with first-party accessibility support.\nWe've exposed Bevy's UI hierarchy and text elements to screen readers and other assistive devices, managed by the new on-by-default bevy_a11y crate.\nThis is ultimately powered by the new AccessibilityNode component, which combines with the existing hierarchy to expose this information directly to AccessKit and the Focus resource, which stores the entity that has keyboard focus.\nThere's still a lot more to be done here: integrating the focus system with a gamepad-driven UI controls solution, cleaning up the data model to make sure \"accessible by default\" is a reality), and adding support for remaining features in AccessKit.\nSpecial thanks to @mwcampbell, the lead author of AccessKit, for reviewing our integration and working with us to reduce the number of dependencies upstream, substantially improving both compile times and final executable size. This is still a serious challenge on Linux, and so the accesskit_unix feature flag is disabled by default for now.\nSpatial Audio\n#\n\nauthors: @mockersf, @DGriffin91, @harudagondi, @alice-i-cecile\nThe library Bevy uses for audio, rodio, contains support for spatial audio. Bevy 0.10 exposes basic spatial audio. There are still a few caveats, like no HRTF and no first class support for Emitter and Listener components.\nInterestingly, during the development of this specific feature, @harudagondi found a bug where the audio channels reverse when running the app in either debug or release mode. This turns out to be a rodio issue, and this also affects previous versions of Bevy. Thanks to @dis-da-moe, the bug has been fixed upstream. See the linked PR for interesting details about audio programming quirks and performance issues.\nYou can now have spatial audio in your game! Clone the bevy repository and invoke cargo run --example spatial_audio_3d --release in the command line for a showcase of 3D spatial audio in Bevy.\nCustom Audio Sources\n#\n\nauthors: @dis-da-moe\nBevy supports custom audio sources through the Decodable trait, but the way to register to the bevy app is very boilerplatey and sparsely documented. In Bevy 0.10, a new extension trait for App is added and the documentation for Decodable has vastly improved.\nAs such, instead of doing this:\nstruct MyCustomAudioSource { /* ... */ }\n\napp.add_asset::&lt;MyCustomAudioSource&gt;()\n    .init_resource::&lt;Audio&lt;MyCustomAudioSource&gt;&gt;()\n    .init_resource::&lt;AudioOutput&lt;MyCustomAudioSource&gt;&gt;()\n    .add_system(play_queued_audio_system::&lt;MyCustomAudioSource&gt;.in_base_set(CoreSet::PostUpdate))\n\nYou only have to do this:\napp.add_audio_source::&lt;MyCustomAudioSource&gt;()\n\nMuch cleaner!\nShaderDef Values\n#\n\nauthors: @mockersf\nBevy's shader processor now supports ShaderDefs with values, using the new ShaderDefVal. This allows developers to pass constant values into their shaders:\nlet shader_defs = vec![\n    ShaderDefVal::Int(\"MAX_DIRECTIONAL_LIGHTS\".to_string(), 10),\n];\n\nThese can be used in #if statements to selectively enable shader code based on the value:\n#if MAX_DIRECTIONAL_LIGHTS &gt;= 10\nlet color = vec4&lt;f32&gt;(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);\n#else\nlet color = vec4&lt;f32&gt;(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0);\n#endif\n\nShaderDef values can be inlined into shaders:\nfor (var i: u32 = 0u; i &lt; #{MAX_DIRECTIONAL_LIGHTS}; i = i + 1u) {\n}\n\nThey can also be defined inline in shaders:\n#define MAX_DIRECTIONAL_LIGHTS 10\n\nShaderDefs defined in shaders override values passed in from Bevy.\n#else ifdef Chains in Shaders\n#\n\nauthors: @torsteingrindvik\nBevy's shader processor now also supports #else ifdef chains like this:\n#ifdef FOO\n// foo code\n#else ifdef BAR\n// bar code\n#else ifdef BAZ\n// baz code\n#else\n// fallback code\n#endif\n\nNew Shader Imports: Global and View\n#\n\nauthors: @torsteingrindvik\nThe Global and View structs are now importable in shaders using #import bevy_render::globals and #import bevy_render::view. Bevy's internal shaders now use these imports (saving a lot of redundancy). Previously you either needed to re-define in each shader or import the larger bevy_pbr::mesh_view_types (which wasn't always what was needed).\nPreviously this was needed:\nstruct View {\n    view_proj: mat4x4&lt;f32&gt;,\n    inverse_view_proj: mat4x4&lt;f32&gt;,\n    view: mat4x4&lt;f32&gt;,\n    inverse_view: mat4x4&lt;f32&gt;,\n    projection: mat4x4&lt;f32&gt;,\n    inverse_projection: mat4x4&lt;f32&gt;,\n    world_position: vec3&lt;f32&gt;,\n    // viewport(x_origin, y_origin, width, height)\n    viewport: vec4&lt;f32&gt;,\n};\n\nNow you can just do this!\n#import bevy_render::view\n\nAdaptive Batching for Parallel Query Iteration\n#\n\nauthors: @james7132\nQuery::par_for_each has been the tool everyone reaches for when their queries get too big to run single-threaded. Got 100,000 entities running around on your screen? No problem, Query::par_for_each chunks it up into smaller batches and distributes the workload over multiple threads. However, in Bevy 0.9 and before, Query::par_for_each required callers to provide a batch size to help tune these batches for maximum performance. This rather opaque knob often resulted in users just randomly picking a value and rolling with it, or fine tuning the value based on their development machines. Unfortunately, the most effective value is dependent on the runtime environment (i.e. how many logical cores does a player's computer have) and the state of the ECS World (i.e. how many entities are matched?). Ultimately most users of the API just chose a flat number and lived with the results, good or bad.\n// 0.9\nconst QUERY_BATCH_SIZE: usize = 32;\n\nquery.par_for_each(QUERY_BATCH_SIZE, |mut component| {\n   // ...\n});\n\nIn 0.10, you no longer need to provide a batch size! If you use Query::par_iter, Bevy will automatically evaluate the state of the World and task pools and select a batch size using a heuristic to ensure sufficient parallelism, without incurring too much overhead. This makes parallel queries as easy to use as normal single-threaded queries! While great for most typical use cases, these heuristics may not be suitable for every workload, so we've provided an escape hatch for those who need finer control over the workload distribution. In the future, we may further tune the backing heuristics to try to get the default to be closer to optimal in these workloads.\n// 0.10\nquery.par_iter().for_each(|component| {\n   // ...\n});\n\n// Fairly easy to convert from a single-threaded for_each. Just change iter to par_iter!\nquery.iter().for_each(|component| {\n   // ...\n});\n\nYou can also use BatchingStrategy for more control over batching:\nquery\n    .par_iter_mut()\n    // run with batches of 100\n    .batching_strategy(BatchingStrategy::fixed(100))\n    .for_each(|mut component| { /* ... */ });\n\nSee the BatchingStrategy docs for more info.\nUnsafeWorldCell and UnsafeEntityCell\n#\n\nauthors: @jakobhellermann, @BoxyUwU and @JoJoJet\nUnsafeWorldCell and UnsafeEntityCell allow shared mutable access to parts of the world via unsafe code. It serves a similar purpose as UnsafeCell, allowing people to build interior mutability abstractions such as Cell Mutex Channel etc. In bevy UnsafeWorldCell will be used to support the scheduler and system param implementations as these are interior mutability abstractions for World, it also currently is used to implement WorldCell. We're planning to use UnsafeEntityCell to implement versions of EntityRef/EntityMut that only have access to the components on the entity rather than the entire world.\nThese abstractions were introduced in #6404, #7381 and #7568.\nCylinder Shape\n#\n\nauthors: @JayPavlina, @rparrett, @davidhof\nThe cylinder shape primitive has joined our zoo of built-in shapes!\n\nSubdividable Plane Shape\n#\n\nauthors: @woodroww\nBevy's Plane shape can now be subdivided any number of times.\n\nCamera Output Modes\n#\n\nauthors: @cart, @robtfm\nThe camera-driven post-processing features added in Bevy 0.9 add intuitive control over post-processing across multiple cameras in a scene, but there were a few corner cases that didn't quite fit into the hard-coded camera output model. And there were some bugs and limitations related to double-buffered target texture sources of truth being incorrect across cameras and MSAA's sampled texture not containing what it should under some circumstances.\nBevy 0.10 adds a CameraOutputMode field to Camera, which gives Bevy app developers the ability to manually configure exactly how (and if) a Camera's render results should be written to the final output texture:\n// Configure the camera to write to the final output texture\ncamera.output_mode = CameraOutputMode::Write {\n    // Do not blend with the current state of the output texture\n    blend_state: None,\n    // Clear the output texture\n    color_attachment_load_op: LoadOp::Clear(Default::default()),\n};\n\n// Configure the camera to skip writing to the final output texture\n// This can save a pass when there are multiple cameras, and can be useful for\n// some post-processing situations\ncamera.output_mode = CameraOutputMode::Skip;\n\nMost single-camera and multi-camera setups will not need to touch this setting at all. But if you need it, it will be waiting for you!\nMSAA requires an extra intermediate \"multisampled\" texture, which gets resolved to the \"actual\" unsampled texture. In some corner case multi-camera setups that render to the same texture, this can create weird / inconsistent results based on whether or not MSAA is enabled or disabled. We've added a new Camera::msaa_writeback bool field which (when enabled) will write the current state of the unsampled texture to the intermediate MSAA texture (if a previous camera has already rendered to the target on a given frame). This ensures that the state is consistent regardless of MSAA configuration. This defaults to true, so you only need to think about this if you have a multi-camera setup and you don't want MSAA writeback.\nConfigurable Visibility Component\n#\n\nauthors: @ickk\nThe Visibility component controls whether or not an Entity should be rendered. Bevy 0.10 reworked the type definition: rather than having a single is_visible: bool field, we now use an enum with an additional mode:\npub enum Visibility {\n  Hidden,    // unconditionally hidden\n  Visible,   // unconditionally visible\n  Inherited, // inherit visibility from parent\n}\n\nMuch easier to understand! In previous Bevy versions, \"inherited visibility\" and \"hidden\" were essentially the only two options. Now entities can opt to be visible, even if their parent is hidden!\nAsBindGroup Storage Buffers\n#\n\nauthors: @IceSentry, @AndrewB330\nAsBindGroup is a useful Bevy trait that makes it very easy to pass data into shaders.\nBevy 0.10 expands this with support for \"storage buffer bindings\", which are very useful when passing in large / unbounded chunks of data:\n#[derive(AsBindGroup)]\nstruct CoolMaterial {\n    #[uniform(0)]\n    color: Color,\n    #[texture(1)]\n    #[sampler(2)]\n    color_texture: Handle&lt;Image&gt;,\n    #[storage(3)]\n    values: Vec&lt;f32&gt;,\n    #[storage(4, read_only, buffer)]\n    buffer: Buffer,\n}\n\nExtractComponent Derive\n#\n\nauthors: @torsteingrindvik\nTo pass component data from the \"main app\" to the \"render app\" for pipelined rendering, we run an \"extract step\". The ExtractComponent trait is used to copy data over. In previous versions of Bevy, you had to implement it manually, but now you can derive it!\n#[derive(Component, Clone, ExtractComponent)]\npub struct Car {\n    pub wheels: usize,\n}\n\nThis expands to this:\nimpl ExtractComponent for Car\n{\n    type Query = &amp;'static Self;\n    type Filter = ();\n    type Out = Self;\n    fn extract_component(item: QueryItem&lt;'_, Self::Query&gt;) -&gt; Option&lt;Self::Out&gt; {\n        Some(item.clone())\n    }\n}\n\nIt also supports filters!\n#[derive(Component, Clone, ExtractComponent)]\n#[extract_component_filter(With&lt;Fuel&gt;)]\npub struct Car {\n    pub wheels: usize,\n}\n\nUpgraded wgpu to 0.15\n#\n\nauthors: @Elabajaba\nBevy 0.10 now uses the latest and greatest wgpu (our choice of low level graphics layer). In addition to a number of nice API improvements and bug fixes, wgpu now uses the DXC shader compiler for DX12, which is faster, less buggy, and allows for new features.\nEnabled OpenGL Backend by Default\n#\n\nauthors: @wangling12\nBevy has supported wgpu's OpenGL backend for a while now, but it was opt-in. This caused Bevy to fail to start up on some machines that don't support modern apis like Vulkan. In Bevy 0.10 the OpenGL backend is enabled by default, which means machines will automatically fall back to OpenGL if no other API is available.\nExposed Non-Uniform Indexing Support (Bindless)\n#\n\nauthors: @cryscan\nBevy 0.10 wired up initial support for non-uniform indexing of textures and storage buffers. This is an important step toward modern \"bindless / gpu-driven rendering\", which can unlock significant performance on platforms that support it. Note that this is just making the feature available to render plugin developers. Bevy's core rendering features do not (yet) use the bindless approach.\nWe've added a new example illustrating how to use this feature:\n\nGamepad API Improvements\n#\n\nauthors: @DevinLeamy\nThe GamepadEventRaw type has been removed in favor of separate GamepadConnectionEvent, GamepadAxisChangedEvent, and GamepadButtonChangedEvent, and the internals have been reworked to accommodate this.\nThis allows for simpler, more granular event access without filtering down the general GamepadEvent type. Nice!\nfn system(mut events: EventReader&lt;GamepadConnectionEvent&gt;)\n    for event in events.iter() {\n    }\n}\n\nInput Method Editor (IME) Support\n#\n\nauthors: @mockersf\nWindow can now configure IME support using ime_enabled and ime_position, which enables the use of \"dead keys\", which add support for French, Pinyin, etc:\n\nReflection Paths: Enums and Tuples\n#\n\nauthors: @MrGVSV\nBevy's \"reflection paths\" enable navigating Rust values using a simple (and dynamic) string syntax. Bevy 0.10 expands this system by adding support for tuples and enums in reflect paths:\n#[derive(Reflect)]\nstruct MyStruct {\n  data: Data,\n  some_tuple: (u32, u32),\n}\n\n#[derive(Reflect)]\nenum Data {\n  Foo(u32, u32),\n  Bar(bool)\n}\n\nlet x = MyStruct {\n  data: Data::Foo(123),\n  some_tuple: (10, 20),\n};\n\nassert_eq!(*x.path::&lt;u32&gt;(\"data.1\").unwrap(), 123);\nassert_eq!(*x.path::&lt;u32&gt;(\"some_tuple.0\").unwrap(), 10);\n\nPre-Parsed Reflection Paths\n#\n\nauthors: @MrGVSV, @james7132 \nReflection paths enable a lot of interesting and dynamic editor scenarios, but they do have a downside: calling path() requires parsing strings every time. To solve this problem we added ParsedPath, which enables pre-parsing paths and then reusing those results on each access:\nlet parsed_path = ParsedPath::parse(\"foo.bar[0]\").unwrap();\nlet element = parsed_path.element::&lt;usize&gt;(&amp;some_value);\n\nMuch more suitable for repeated access, such as doing the same lookup every frame!\nReflectFromReflect\n#\n\nauthors: @MrGVSV\nWhen using Bevy's Rust reflection system, we sometimes end up in a scenario where we have a \"dynamic reflect value\" representing a certain type MyType (even though under the hood, it isn't really that type). Such scenarios happen when we call Reflect::clone_value, use the reflection deserializers, or create the dynamic value ourselves. Unfortunately, we can't just call MyType::from_reflect as we do not have knowledge of the concrete MyType at runtime.\nReflectFromReflect is a new \"type data\" struct in the TypeRegistry that enables FromReflect trait operations without any concrete references to a given type. Very cool!\n#[derive(Reflect, FromReflect)]\n#[reflect(FromReflect)] // &lt;- Register `ReflectFromReflect`\nstruct MyStruct(String);\n\nlet type_id = TypeId::of::&lt;MyStruct&gt;();\n\n// Register our type\nlet mut registry = TypeRegistry::default();\nregistry.register::&lt;MyStruct&gt;();\n\n// Create a concrete instance\nlet my_struct = MyStruct(\"Hello world\".to_string());\n\n// `Reflect::clone_value` will generate a `DynamicTupleStruct` for tuple struct types\n// Note that this is _not_ a MyStruct instance\nlet dynamic_value: Box&lt;dyn Reflect&gt; = my_struct.clone_value();\n\n// Get the `ReflectFromReflect` type data from the registry\nlet rfr: &amp;ReflectFromReflect = registry\n  .get_type_data::&lt;ReflectFromReflect&gt;(type_id)\n  .unwrap();\n\n// Call `FromReflect::from_reflect` on our Dynamic value\nlet concrete_value: Box&lt;dyn Reflect&gt; = rfr.from_reflect(&amp;dynamic_value);\nassert!(concrete_value.is::&lt;MyStruct&gt;());\n\nOther Reflection Improvements\n#\n\nauthors: @james7132, @soqb, @cBournhonesque, @SkiFire13\n\nReflect is now implemented for std::collections::VecDeque\nReflected List types now have insert and remove operations\nReflected Map types now have the remove operation\nReflected generic types now automatically implement Reflect if the generics also implement Reflect. No need to add manual T: Reflect bounds!\nComponent Reflection now uses EntityRef / EntityMut instead of both World and Entity, which allows it to be used in more scenarios\nThe Reflection deserializer now avoids unnecessarily cloning strings in some scenarios!\n\nUpgraded Taffy To 0.3\n#\n\nauthors: @ickshonpe, @rparret\nTaffy is the library we use to compute layouts for bevy_ui. Taffy 0.2 significantly improves the performance of nested UIs (our many_buttons example is now 8% faster and more deeply nested UIs should see even bigger gains!). It also brings support for the gap property which makes it easier to creates UI with evenly spaced items. Taffy 0.3 adds some nice API tweaks (and also a grid layout feature, which we have disabled for now as it still needs some integration work).\nRelative Cursor Position\n#\n\nauthors: @Pietrek14\nWe've added a new RelativeCursorPosition UI component, which when added to a UI entity tracks the cursor position relative to the node. Some((0, 0)) represents the top-left corner of the node, Some((1,1)) represents the bottom-right corner of the node, and None represents the cursor being \"outside of the node\".\ncommands.spawn((\n    NodeBundle::default(),\n    RelativeCursorPosition::default(),\n));\n\nConst Bevy UI Defaults\n#\n\nauthors: @james-j-obrien\nBevy uses the Default trait a lot to make it easy to construct types. Bevy UI types generally implement Default. However, it has one downside (which is fundamental to Rust): Default cannot be used in const contexts (yet!). To enable UI layout config to be defined as constants, we've added DEFAULT associated constants to most of the Bevy UI types. For example, you can use Style::DEFAULT to define a const style:\nconst COOL_STYLE: Style = Style {\n    size: Size::width(Val::Px(200.0)),\n    border: UiRect::all(Val::Px(2.0)),\n    ..Style::DEFAULT\n};\n\nIterating through a World's Entities\n#\n\nauthors: @james7132\nIn Bevy 0.9, World::iter_entities allows users to get an iterator over all of the entities in the World in Entity form. In Bevy 0.10, this has been changed to be an iterator over EntityRef, which gives full read-only access to all of the entity's components instead of just getting its ID. Its new implementation should also be significantly faster than fetching the EntityRef by hand (though note that a Query will still be faster if you know the exact components you're looking for). This gives users free rein to arbitrarily read any entity data from the World, and may see use in scripting language integrations and reflection-heavy workflows.\n// Bevy 0.9\nfor entity in world.iter_entities() {\n   if let Some(entity_ref) = world.get_entity(entity) {\n      if let Some(component) = entity_ref.get::&lt;MyComponent&gt;() {\n         ...\n      }\n   }\n}\n\n// Bevy 0.10\nfor entity_ref in world.iter_entities() {\n   if let Some(component) = entity_ref.get::&lt;MyComponent&gt;() {\n      ...\n   }\n}\n\nIn the future, we may have a World::iter_entities_mut that exposes this functionality, but gives arbitrary mutable access to all entities in the World. We avoided implementing this for now due to the potential safety concerns of returning an iterator of EntityMut. For more details, see this GitHub issue.\nLCH Color Space\n#\n\nauthors: @ldubos\nBevy's Color type now supports the LCH color space (Lightness, Chroma, Hue). LCH has a lot of arguments for it, including that it provides access to about 50% more colors over sRGB. Check out this article for more information.\nColor::Lcha {\n    lightness: 1.0,\n    chroma: 0.5,\n    hue: 200.0,\n    alpha: 1.0,\n}\n\nOptimized Color::hex Performance\n#\n\nauthors: @wyhaya\nColor::hex is now a const function, which brought the runtime of hex from ~14ns to ~4ns!\nSplit Up CorePlugin\n#\n\nauthors: @targrub\nCorePlugin has historically been a bit of a \"kitchen sink plugin\". \"Core\" things that didn't fit anywhere else ended up there. This isn't a great organizational strategy, so we broke it up into individual pieces: TaskPoolPlugin, TypeRegistrationPlugin, and FrameCountPlugin.\nEntityCommands\n#\n\nauthors: @JoJoJet\nCommands are \"deferred ECS\" operations. They enable developers to define custom ECS operations that are applied after a parallel system has finished running. Many Commands ran on individual entities, but this pattern was a bit cumbersome:\nstruct MyCustomCommand(Entity);\n\nimpl Command for MyCustomCommand {\n    fn write(self, world: &amp;mut World) {\n        // do something with the entity at self.0\n    }\n}\n\nlet id = commands.spawn(SpriteBundle::default()).id();\ncommmands.add(MyCustomCommand(id));\n\nTo solve this, in Bevy 0.10 we added the EntityCommand trait. This allows the command to be ergonomically applied to spawned entities:\nstruct MyCustomCommand;\n\nimpl EntityCommand for MyCustomCommand {\n    fn write(self, id: Entity, world: &amp;mut World) {\n        // do something with the given entity id\n    }\n}\n\ncommands.spawn(SpriteBundle::default()).add(MyCustomCommand);\n\nPixel Perfect Example\n#\n\nauthors: @Ian-Yy\nWe now have a new \"pixel perfect\" example that illustrates how to set up pixel-perfect sprites. It uses a cute new Bevy logo sprite!\n\nUI Text Layout Example\n#\n\nauthors: @ickshonpe\nWe've added a nice \"text layout\" example that illustrates the various Bevy UI text layout settings:\n\nCI Improvements\n#\n\nauthors: @mockersf\nWe take CI pretty seriously in Bevy land and we're always on the lookout for new ways to make our lives better. We made a number of nice improvements this cycle:\n\nWe now set an MSRV (minimum supported Rust version) for the bevy crate and we have a CI job that checks the MSRV\nCI gives new contributors a friendly welcome message!\nCI now asks for a migration guide when a PR is labeled as a breaking change and no migration guide is present\n\nThe First Subject Matter Expert Release\n#\n\nThis was our first release using our new Subject Matter Expert (SME) system. We merged an absolutely massive amount of changes, and this was despite our Project Lead @cart being away for about a month for Christmas and snowboarding vacations. We maintained a high quality bar and built amazing things. Suffice it to say the future is looking bright (and sustainable)! Stay tuned for more SME appointments in more areas.\nWhat's Next?\n#\n\n\nAsset System Evolution: We've made good progress on the next iteration of the Bevy Asset System, which will add the ability to preprocess assets and improve the flexibility and usability of the asset system.\nKicking off the Bevy Editor Effort: We are ready to start shifting our focus to building out the Bevy Editor! We've started gathering requirements and would like to start the initial design phase in the Bevy 0.11 cycle.\nTemporal Anti-Aliasing (TAA): We've largely implemented TAA, which uses motion vectors and time to produce a very popular screen space anti-aliasing effect.\nScreen Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO): This is a popular, relatively cheap illumination technique that can make scenes look much more natural. It builds on the Depth Prepass work.\nAutomated Render Batching and Instancing: Automatically cut down draw calls by combining geometry or using instancing. This will enable Bevy to render hundreds of thousands of objects without grinding to a halt. We technically already support this, but it must be implemented manually outside of our standard pipeline. This will bring batching and instancing wins \"for free\" in our built-in render pipeline.\nOne-shot systems: Run arbitrary systems in a push-based fashion via commands, and store them as callback components for ultra-flexible behavior customization.\nBetter plugins: Clearer and more standardized tools for adapting third-party plugins to your app's unique architecture, eliminating order-dependence in their initialization and defining dependencies between them.\nPull !Send data out of the World: storing non thread-safe data in a structure designed to be sent across threads has caused us no end of headaches. We plan on pulling these out into the App, resolving a major blocker for a first-class multiple worlds design.\nTimestamp window and input events: As discussed in #5984, tracking the exact timing of input events is essential to ensuring that event ordering and timing can be precisely reconstructed.\nOpt-out change detection: improve performance for tiny components by turning off change detection at compile or run-time.\nComprehensive Animation Composition: Supporting non-transitional animation composition (i.e. arbitrary weighted blending of animations). For more complete information, see the RFC.\n\nCheck out the Bevy 0.11 Milestone for an up-to-date list of current work being considered for Bevy 0.11.\nSupport Bevy\n#\n\nSponsorships help make our work on Bevy sustainable.

You can check out Quick Start Guide to get started. Bevy is also free and open source forever! You can grab the full source code on GitHub.\nHere are some of the highlights from this release:\nAsync Task System\n#\n\nauthors: @lachlansneff and @aclysma\nBevy uses multi-threading throughout the engine: ECS scheduling, asset loading, rendering, etc. Before this release it used Rayon for almost all of these tasks. Rayon is nice because it is generally as simple as calling some_list.par_iter().for_each(|x| do_something(x)). Rayon then automatically breaks the for_each into tasks and runs them on as many cores as it can. Rayon is a great choice if you want to easily parallelize code, but it has the downside of being pretty cpu-hungry.\nBevy (and a number of other rust game engines and ecs frameworks using rayon) have received feedback that they were overly cpu hungry / usage was not proportional to \"real\" work done.\nWe decided to resolve this problem by building a custom async-friendly task system, which enables the creation of context-specific task pools. For example, you might have separate pools for compute, IO, networking, etc. This also gives us the flexibility to load balance work appropriately according to work type and/or priority. The cpu usage wins have been huge:\nTotal Combined Percent CPU Usage - 8 Core Machine (smaller is better)\n#\n\n\nTotal Combined Percent CPU Usage - 32 Core Machine (smaller is better)\n#\n\n\nInitial Web Platform Support\n#\n\nauthors: @smokku\n(A subset of) Bevy now runs on the web using WebAssembly/WASM! Specifically, Bevy apps can run Bevy ECS schedules, react to input events, create an empty canvas (using winit), and a few other things. This is a huge first step, but it is important to call out that there are still a number of missing pieces, such as 2D/3D rendering, multi-threading, and sound.\nThose limitations haven't stopped @mrk-its from building the first WASM Bevy game!\nbevy-robbo (playable here)\n#\n\n\nThey use Bevy for game logic and cleverly work around the render limitations by passing ASCII art game state from this Bevy system to this JavaScript function.\nYou can play around with some Bevy WASM examples by following the instructions here.\nParallel Queries\n#\n\nauthors: @GrantMoyer\nBevy ECS Queries are a flexible way to retrieve data from the Entity Component System. Systems that use queries already run in parallel, but before this change the queries themselves could not be iterated in parallel. Bevy 0.2 adds the ability to easily iterate queries in parallel:\nfn system(pool: Res&lt;ComputeTaskPool&gt;, mut query: Query&lt;&amp;mut Transform&gt;) {\n    query.iter().par_iter(32).for_each(&amp;pool, |mut transform| {\n      transform.translate(Vec3::new(1.0, 0.0, 0.0));\n    });\n}\n\nThis provides a nice functional api (similar to Rayon) that runs on top of the new bevy_tasks system. It breaks the query up into 32 \"batches\" and runs each batch as a different task in the bevy task system.\nTransform System Rewrite\n#\n\nauthors: @MarekLg\n// old\nfn system(translation: &amp;Translation, rotation: &amp;Rotation, scale: &amp;Scale) {\n  println!(\"{} {} {}\", translation.0, rotation.0, scale.0);\n}\n\n// new\nfn system(transform: &amp;Transform) {\n  println!(\"{} {} {}\", transform.translation(), transform.rotation(), transform.scale());\n}\n\nBevy's old transform system used separate Translation, Rotation, and Scale components as the \"source of truth\". Users modified with these components in their systems, after which they were synced to a LocalTransform component, which was in turn synced to a global Transform component, taking hierarchy into account. This was nice for a couple of reasons:\n\nSlightly more cache efficient to retrieve individual components like Translation (because less data needs to be accessed)\nTheoretically more parallel-friendly. Systems that only access Translation won't block systems accessing Rotation.\n\nHowever this approach also has some pretty serious downsides:\n\nThe \"individual components\" are the source of truth, so LocalTransform is out of date when user systems are running. If an up to date \"full transform\" is needed, it must be manually constructed by accessing all three components.\nVery hard to reason about. There are 5 components users need to think about and they all interact with each other differently.\nSetting a Transform to a specific matrix value (ex: Mat4::look_at()) was extremely cumbersome, and the value would be immediately overwritten unless the user explicitly disabled component syncing.\n\nGiven these issues, we decided to move to a single unified local-to-parent Transform component as the source of truth, and a computed GlobalTransform component for world-space transforms. We think this api will be much easier to use and to reason about. Unity is also considering a similar Transform rework for their ECS and a lot of discussion on this topic happened in this Amethyst Forum Thread.\nJoystick/Gamepad Input\n#\n\nauthors: @simpuid\nThe Bevy Input plugin now has cross-platform support for most controllers thanks to the gilrs library!\nfn button_system(gamepads: Res&lt;Vec&lt;Gamepad&gt;&gt;, button_input: Res&lt;Input&lt;GamepadButton&gt;&gt;) {\n    for gamepad in gamepads.iter() {\n        if button_input.just_pressed(GamepadButton(*gamepad, GamepadButtonType::RightTrigger)) {\n            println!(\"Pressed right trigger!\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nBevy ECS Performance Improvements\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\nGenerational Entity IDs\n#\n\nWe changed Entity IDs from being random UUIDs to incrementing generational indices. Random UUIDs were nice because they could be created anywhere, were unique across game runs, and could be safely persisted to files or reused across networks. I was really hoping we could make them work, but they ended up being too slow relative to the alternatives. The randomness had a measurable cost and entity locations had to be looked up using a hash map.\nBy moving to generational indices (we use the hecs implementation), we can directly use entity ids as array indices, which makes entity location lookups lightning fast.\nRead Only Queries\n#\n\nI implemented \"read only\" traits for queries that don't mutate anything. This allows us to guarantee that a query won't mutate anything.\nRemoved locking from World apis\n#\n\nThis gives us a really nice speed boost. We can do this safely due to a combination of the new \"read only queries\" and changing World mutation apis to be a mutable World borrow.\nThis is not yet enabled for Queries in systems because a system could have multiple Queries, which could be simultaneously accessed in a way that doesn't make mutable access unique. I think thats a solve-able problem, but it will take a bit more work. Fortunately \"for-each\" systems don't have any collision risk, so we now use lock-less queries there.\nDirect component lookup (in nanoseconds, smaller is better)\n#\n\nAs a result of these optimizations, direct component lookup is much faster than it used to be:\n\nNote that this benchmark used world.get::&lt;T&gt;(entity). query.get::&lt;T&gt;(entity) should have results similar to the hecs results because it still uses a lock. Eventually I'm hoping that we can remove locks from system queries too.\nChange Log\n#\n\nAdded\n#\n\n\nTask System for Bevy\n\nReplaces rayon with a custom designed task system that consists of several \"TaskPools\".\nExports IOTaskPool, ComputePool, and AsyncComputePool in bevy_tasks crate.\n\n\nParallel queries for distributing work over with the ParallelIterator trait.\n\ne.g. query.iter().par_iter(batch_size).for_each(/* ... */)\n\n\nAdded gamepad support using Gilrs\nImplement WASM support for bevy_winit\nCreate winit canvas under WebAssembly\nImplement single threaded task scheduler for WebAssembly\nSupport for binary glTF (.glb).\nSupport for Or in ECS queries.\nAdded methods unload() and unload_sync() on SceneSpawner for unloading scenes..\nCustom rodio source for audio.\n\nAudioOuput is now able to play anything Decodable.\n\n\nColor::hex for creating Color from string hex values.\n\nAccepts the forms RGB, RGBA, RRGGBB, and RRGGBBAA.\n\n\nColor::rgb_u8 and Color::rgba_u8.\nAdded bevy_render::pass::ClearColor to prelude.\nSpriteResizeMode may choose how Sprite resizing should be handled.

This one is also hot off the presses: some features will work and others probably won't.\nThis was another large group effort that spanned multiple projects:\n\nBevy: XCode Project / Example (@simlay with help from @MichaelHills)\nBevy: Runtime shader compilation using shaderc (@MichaelHills)\nBevy: Rodio upgrade (@Dash-L)\nBevy: Touch support (@naithar)\nWinit: Fix iOS portrait view (@MichaelHills)\nRustAudio: iOS support (@simlay and @MichaelHills)\n\nKnown issues:\n\nAudio doesn't quite work yet\n\nWASM Asset Loading\n#\n\nauthors: @mrk-its (and ported to the new AssetIo by @cart)\n@mrk-its has been hard at work on expanding Bevy's WASM support. In this release we landed WASM asset loading. You can now load assets when you publish to WASM just like you would on any other platform:\nasset_server.load(\"sprite.png\");\n\nIf the asset hasn't already been loaded, this will make a fetch() request to retrieve the asset over HTTP.\n@mrk-its has also been building a custom WebGL2 bevy_render backend. It is already pretty usable, but its not quite ready yet. Expect more news on this soon!\nTouch Input\n#\n\nauthors: @naithar\nBevy now has support for touches:\nfn touch_system(touches: Res&lt;Touches&gt;) {\n    // you can iterate all current touches and retrieve their state like this:\n    for touch in touches.iter() {\n        println!(\"active touch: {:?}\", touch);\n    }\n\n    for touch in touches.iter_just_pressed() {\n        println!(\"just pressed {:?}\", touch);\n    }\n\n    for touch in touches.iter_just_released() {\n        println!(\"just released {:?}\", touch);\n    }\n\n    for touch in touches.iter_just_cancelled() {\n        println!(\"just cancelled {:?}\", touch);\n    }\n}\n\nYou can also consume raw touch events using the Events&lt;TouchInput&gt; resource.\nAsset System Improvements\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\nAsset Handle Reference Counting\n#\n\nAssets are now automatically freed when their \"handle reference count\" reaches zero. This means you no longer need to think about freeing assets manually:\n// Calling load() now returns a strong handle:\nlet handle = asset_server.load(\"sprite.png\");\n\n// Note that you no longer need to unwrap() loaded handles. Ergonomics for the win!\n\n// Cloning a handle increases the reference count by one\nlet second_handle = handle.clone();\n\n// Spawn a sprite and give it our handle\ncommands.spawn(SpriteComponents {\n    material: materials.add(handle.into()),\n    ..Default::default()\n});\n\n// Later in some other system:\ncommands.despawn(sprite_entity);\n\n// There are no more active handles to \"sprite.png\", so it will be freed before the next update\n\nAsset Loaders can now load multiple assets\n#\n\nIn past releases, AssetLoaders could only produce a single asset of a single type. In Bevy 0.3, they can now produce any number of assets for any type. The old behavior was extremely limiting when loading assets like GLTF files, which might produce many meshes, textures, and scenes.\nSub-Asset Loading\n#\n\nSometimes you only want to load a specific asset from an asset source. You can now load sub assets like this:\n// Mesh0/Primitive0 references the first mesh primitive in \"my_scene.gltf\"\nlet mesh = asset_server.load(\"my_scene.gltf#Mesh0/Primitive0\");\n\nAssetIo Trait\n#\n\nThe AssetServer is now backed by the AssetIo trait. This allows us to load assets from whatever storage we want. This means on desktop we now load from the filesystem, on Android we use the Android Asset Manager, and on the web we make HTTP requests using the fetch() api.\nAsset Dependencies\n#\n\nAssets can now depend on other assets, which will automatically be loaded when the original asset is loaded. This is useful when loading something like a \"scene\" which might reference other asset sources. We utilize this in our new GLTF loader.\nRemoved AssetServer::load_sync()\n#\n\nThis might rustle some feathers, but AssetServer::load_sync() had to go! This api wasn't WASM friendly, encouraged users to block game execution for the sake of convenience (which causes \"hitching\"), and was incompatible with the new AssetLoader api. Asset loading is now always asynchronous. Users of load_sync() should instead load() their assets, check load status in their systems, and change game state accordingly.\nGLTF Scene Loader\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\nUp until this point, the GLTF loader was painfully limited. It could only load the first mesh with a single texture in a GLTF file. For Bevy 0.3, we took advantage of the asset system improvements to write a new GltfLoader that loads GLTF files as Bevy Scenes, along with all meshes and textures in the files.\nHere's Bevy loading the Khronos Flight Helmet example, which consists of multiple meshes and textures!\n\nHere is the complete code for a system that loads a GLTF file and spawns it as a scene:\nfn load_gltf_system(mut commands: Commands, asset_server: Res&lt;AssetServer&gt;) {\n    let scene_handle = asset_server.load(\"models/FlightHelmet/FlightHelmet.gltf\");\n    commands.spawn_scene(scene_handle);\n}\n\nBevy ECS Improvements\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\nQuery Ergonomics\n#\n\nIn this release I finally was able to remove the one thing I truly despised in Bevy ECS. In previous versions of Bevy, iterating over the components in a Query looked like this:\nfor (a, b) in &amp;mut query.iter() {\n    // The `&amp;mut` here just felt so unnatural\n}\n\n// Or if you preferred you could do this\nfor (a, b) in query.iter().iter() {\n    // query.iter().iter()? Really???\n}\n\nSimilarly, retrieving a specific entity's component's looked like this:\nif let Ok(mut result) = query.entity(entity) {\n    if let Some((a, b)) = result.get() {\n        // access components here\n    }\n}\n\nIn Bevy 0.3 you can just do this:\n// iteration\nfor (a, b) in query.iter() {\n    // sweet ergonomic bliss\n}\n\n// entity lookup\nif let Ok((a,b)) = query.get(entity) {\n    // boilerplate be gone!\n}\n\nYou might naturally be thinking something like:\nWhy did this take so long? Why would removing a single &amp;mut be hard?\nIt's a long story! In summary:\n\nThe old api looked the way it did for a reason. It was the result of good design choices that protect against unsafe memory access in a parallel environment.\nquery.iter() didn't actually return an iterator. It returned a wrapper that held an atomic lock on the component storages. The same was true for the type returned by query.entity()\nRemoving these \"wrapper types\" would have allowed unsafe behavior because another Query could access the same components in a way that violated Rust's mutability rules.\nDue to the iterator implementation and quirks in the rust compiler, removing the wrapper type tanked iteration performance by about ~2-3x.\n\nFortunately we finally found ways to solve all of these problems. The newly added QuerySets allow us to completely remove the locks (and wrapper types). And by completely rewriting QueryIter we were able to avoid the performance hit that removing the wrapper incurred. Read on for the details!\n100% Lockless Parallel ECS\n#\n\nBevy ECS is now completely lock free. In Bevy 0.2, we made direct World access and \"for-each\" systems lock free. This is possible because the Bevy ECS scheduler ensures that systems only run in parallel in ways that respect Rust's mutability rules.\nWe couldn't remove locks from Query systems because of systems like this:\nfn conflicting_query_system(mut q0: Query&lt;&amp;mut A&gt;, mut q1: Query&lt;(&amp;mut A, &amp;B)&gt;) {\n    let a = q0.get_mut(some_entity).unwrap();\n    let (another_a, b) = q1.get_mut(some_entity).unwrap();\n    // Aaah!!! We have two mutable references to some_entity's A component!\n    // Very unsafe!\n}\n\nThe locks ensured that the second q1.get_mut(some_entity) access panicked, keeping us nice and safe. In Bevy 0.3, a system like conflicting_query_system will fail when the schedule is constructed. By default, systems cannot have conflicting queries.\nHowever there are some cases where a system needs conflicting queries to do what it needs to do. For these cases, we added QuerySets:\nfn system(mut queries: QuerySet&lt;(Query&lt;&amp;mut A&gt;, Query&lt;(&amp;mut A, &amp;B)&gt;)&gt;) {\n    for a in queries.q0_mut().iter_mut() {\n    }\n\n    for (a, b) in queries.q1_mut().iter_mut() {\n    }\n}\n\nBy putting our conflicting Queries in a QuerySet, the Rust borrow checker protects us from unsafe query accesses.\nBecause of this, we were able to remove all safety checks from query.iter() and query.get(entity), which means these methods are now exactly as fast as their World counterparts (which we made lock-free in Bevy 0.2).\nPerformance Improvements\n#\n\nBevy had a number of nice performance improvements this release:\n\nRemoved atomic locks from Query access, making Bevy ECS 100% lock free\nRemoved archetype \"safety checks\" from Query access. At this point we have already verified that the given Query access is safe, so we don't need to check again on every call.\nRewrote QueryIter to be simpler (and therefore easier to control optimizations for), which allowed us to remove the iterator wrapper without tanking performance. This also resolved some performance inconsistencies where some system permutations performed optimally and others didn't. Now everything is on the \"fast path\"!\nPorted some performance improvements from upstream hecs, which improved iteration over heavily fragmented archetypes and improved component insertion times\n\nGetting an Entity's Component (per 100k, in milliseconds, smaller is better)\n#\n\nNote: these numbers are for getting a component 100,000 times, not for an individual component lookup\n\nThis is where the big wins were. By removing locks and safety checks from Query systems, we were able to significantly reduce the cost of retrieving a specific entity's component from within a system.\nI included a comparison to Legion ECS (another great archetypal ECS with a parallel scheduler) to illustrate why Bevy's new approach is so cool. Legion exposes a direct \"world like\" api (called a SubWorld) in its systems. The SubWorld's entry api cannot know ahead of time what types will be passed into it, which means it must do (relatively) expensive safety checks to ensure the user doesn't request access to something they shouldn't.\nBevy's scheduler pre-checks Queries once ahead of time, which allows systems to access their results without any additional checks.\nThe test was to lookup (and modify) a specific entity's component 100,000 times on each system iteration. Here is a quick rundown of how these tests were performed in each case:\n\nbevy (world): Direct World access using world.get_mut::&lt;A&gt;(entity)\nbevy (system): A system containing a Query&lt;&amp;mut A&gt; that accesses the component using query.get_mut(entity)\nlegion (world): Direct World access using let entry = world.entry(entity); entry.get_component_mut::&lt;A&gt;()\nlegion (system): A system with SubWorld access using let entry = world.entry(entity); entry.get_component_mut::&lt;A&gt;()\n\nIt's worth noting that using query.get_component::&lt;T&gt;(entity) instead of query.get(entity) does require safety checks, for the same reason the legion entry api does. We cannot know ahead of time what component type a caller will pass into the method, which means we must check it to make sure it matches the Query.\nAdditionally, here are some relevant ecs_bench_suite results (omitted benchmarks had no significant change):\nComponent Insertion (in microseconds, smaller is better)\n#\n\n\nComponent Add/Remove (in milliseconds, smaller is better)\n#\n\n\nFragmented Iteration (in nanoseconds, smaller is better)\n#\n\n\nThread Local Resources\n#\n\nSome resource types cannot (or should not) be passed between threads. This is often true for low level apis like windowing, input, and audio. It is now possible to add \"thread local resources\" to the Resources collection, which can only be accessed from the main thread using \"thread local systems\":\n// in your app setup\napp.add_thread_local_resource(MyResource);\n\n// a thread local system\nfn system(world: &amp;mut World, resources: &amp;mut Resources) {\n    let my_resource = resources.get_thread_local::&lt;MyResource&gt;().unwrap();\n}\n\nQuery Api Changes\n#\n\nFirst, to improve clarity we renamed query.get::&lt;Component&gt;(entity) to query.get_component::&lt;Component&gt;(entity). We now return the \"full\" query result for a specific entity using query.get(entity).\nTo allow multiple concurrent reads of Queries (where it is safe), we added separate query.iter() and query.iter_mut() apis, as well as query.get(entity) and query.get_mut(entity). Queries that are \"read only\" can now retrieve their results via an immutable borrow.\nMesh Improvements\n#\n\nFlexible Mesh Vertex Attributes\n#\n\nauthors: @julhe\nBevy meshes used to require exactly three \"vertex attributes\": position, normal, and uv. This worked for most things, but there are a number of cases that require other attributes, such as \"vertex colors\" or \"bone weights for animation\". Bevy 0.3 adds support for custom vertex attributes. Meshes can define whatever attributes they want and shaders can consume whatever attributes they want!\nHere is an example that illustrates how to define a custom shader that consumes a mesh with an added \"vertex color\" attribute.\n\nIndex Buffer Specialization\n#\n\nauthors: @termhn\nRendering meshes often involves using vertex \"indices\" to cut down on duplicate vertex information. Bevy used to hard code the precision of these indices to u16, which was too small for some cases. Now render pipelines can \"specialize\" based on a configured index buffer, which now defaults to u32 to cover most use cases.\nTransform Re-Rewrite\n#\n\nauthors: @MarekLg (with some design help from @AThilenius, @bitshifter, @termhn, and @cart)\nTransforms are important to get right. They are used in many slices of the engine, user code touches them constantly, and they are relatively expensive to compute: especially transform hierarchies.\nIn the last release, we vastly simplified Bevy's transform system to use a consolidated Transform and GlobalTransform instead of multiple separate Translation, Rotation, and Scale components (which were synced to Transform and GlobalTransform). This made the user-facing api/dataflow simpler, as well as the underlying implementation. The Transform component was backed by a 4x4 matrix. I pressed the big green \"merge\" button ... happy that we had solved the Transform problem once and for all!\nIt turns out there was still more work to be done! @AThilenius pointed out that using a 4x4 matrix as the source of truth for an affine transform accumulates error over time. Additionally, the Transform api was still a little cumbersome to use. At the suggestion of @termhn we decided to investigate using a \"similarity\" as the source of truth. This had the following benefits:\n\nno more error accumulation\nwe could directly expose translation/rotation/scale fields, which simplified the api significantly\ncheaper to store and cheaper to compute hierarchies in some cases\n\nWe collectively decided this was a good path forward and now we have a re-rewrite that is even better. Yes this is another breaking change, but thats why we label Bevy as being in the \"experimentation phase\". Now is the time to break things as often as possible to ensure that we find good apis that will stand the test of time.\nThis is what the new Transform api looks like in a Bevy ECS system:\nfn system(mut transform: Mut&lt;Transform&gt;) {\n    // move along the positive x-axis\n    transform.translation += Vec3::new(1.0, 0.0, 0.0);\n\n    // rotate 180 degrees (pi) around the y-axis\n    transform.rotation *= Quat::from_rotation_y(PI);\n\n    // scale 2x\n    transform.scale *= 2.0;\n}\n\nCompared to the last version this is easier to use, more correct, and should also be slightly faster.\nGamepad Settings\n#\n\nauthors: @simpuid\nThe newly added GamepadSettings resource gives developers the ability to customize gamepad settings on a per-controller, per-axis/button basis:\nfn system(mut gamepad_settings: ResMut&lt;GamepadSettings&gt;) {\n    gamepad_settings.axis_settings.insert(\n        GamepadAxis(Gamepad(0), GamepadAxisType::LeftStickX),\n        AxisSettings {\n            positive_high: 0.8,\n            positive_low: 0.01,\n            ..Default::default()\n        },\n    );\n}\n\nPlugin Groups\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\nIf you've used Bevy, you're probably familiar with this part of App initialization:\napp.add_default_plugins();\n\nThis adds the plugins for all of the \"core\" engine functionality (rendering, input, audio, windowing, etc). It was straightforward, but also very static. What if you don't want to add all of the default plugins? What if you want to create your own custom set of plugins?\nTo resolve this, we added PluginGroups, which are ordered collections of plugins that can be individually enabled or disabled:\n// This:\napp.add_default_plugins()\n\n// Has been replaced by this:\napp.add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n\n// You can disable specific plugins in a PluginGroup:\napp.add_plugins_with(DefaultPlugins, |group| {\n    group.disable::&lt;RenderPlugin&gt;()\n         .disable::&lt;AudioPlugin&gt;()\n});\n\n// And you can create your own PluginGroups:\npub struct HelloWorldPlugins;\n\nimpl PluginGroup for HelloWorldPlugins {\n    fn build(&amp;mut self, group: &amp;mut PluginGroupBuilder) {\n        group.add(PrintHelloPlugin)\n             .add(PrintWorldPlugin);\n    }\n}\n\napp.add_plugins(HelloWorldPlugins);\n\nDynamic Window Settings\n#\n\nauthors: @mockersf\nBevy provides a backend-agnostic windowing api. Up until this point, window settings could only be set once at app startup. If you wanted to set window settings dynamically, you had to directly interact with window backends (ex: winit).\nIn this release we added the ability to dynamically set window properties at runtime using the Bevy window abstraction:\n// This system dynamically sets the window title to the number of seconds since startup. Because why not?\nfn change_title(time: Res&lt;Time&gt;, mut windows: ResMut&lt;Windows&gt;) {\n    let window = windows.get_primary_mut().unwrap();\n    window.set_title(format!(\n        \"Seconds since startup: {}\", time.seconds_since_startup\n    ));\n}\n\nDocumentation Search-ability\n#\n\nauthors: @memoryruins\nThe  bevy crate documentation search function now returns results for all sub-crates (like bevy_sprite). Due to how documentation is generated for re-exported crates, by default the bevy search index only covered the \"prelude\". @memoryruins found a way to fix this problem by creating new modules and exporting the contents of each crate within those modules (as opposed to aliasing the crates).\n\nChange Log\n#\n\nAdded\n#\n\n\nTouch Input\niOS XCode Project\nAndroid Example and use bevy-glsl-to-spirv 0.2.0\nIntroduce Mouse capture API\nbevy_input::touch: implement touch input\nD-pad support on MacOS\nSupport for Android file system\napp: PluginGroups and DefaultPlugins\n\nPluginGroup is a collection of plugins where each plugin can be enabled or disabled.\n\n\nSupport to get gamepad button/trigger values using Axis&lt;GamepadButton&gt;\nExpose Winit decorations\nEnable changing window settings at runtime\nExpose a pointer of EventLoopProxy to process custom messages\nAdd a way to specify padding/ margins between sprites in a TextureAtlas\nAdd bevy_ecs::Commands::remove for bundles\nimpl Default for TextureFormat\nExpose current_entity in ChildBuilder\nAppBuilder::add_thread_local_resource\nCommands::write_world_boxed takes a pre-boxed world writer to the ECS's command queue\nFrameTimeDiagnosticsPlugin now shows \"frame count\" in addition to \"frame time\" and \"fps\"\nAdd hierarchy example\nWgpuPowerOptions for choosing between low power, high performance, and adaptive power\nDerive Debug for more types: #597, #632\nIndex buffer specialization\n\nAllows the use of U32 indices in Mesh index buffers in addition to the usual U16 indices\nSwitch to u32 indices by default\n\n\nMore instructions for system dependencies\n\nAdd systemd-devel for Fedora Linux dependencies\nAdd libudev-dev to Ubuntu dependencies\nAdd Void Linux to linux dependencies file\nWSL2 instructions\n\n\nSuggest -Zrun-dsymutil-no for faster compilation on MacOS\n\nChanged\n#\n\n\necs: ergonomic query.iter(), remove locks, add QuerySets\n\nquery.iter() is now a real iterator!\nQuerySet allows working with conflicting queries and is checked at compile-time.\n\n\nRename query.entity() and query.get()\n\nquery.get::&lt;Component&gt;(entity) is now query.get_component::&lt;Component&gt;(entity)\nquery.entity(entity) is now query.get(entity)\n\n\nAsset system rework and GLTF scene loading\nIntroduces WASM implementation of AssetIo\nMove transform data out of Mat4\nSeparate gamepad state code from gamepad event code and other customizations\ngamepad: expose raw and filtered gamepad events\nDo not depend on spirv-reflect on wasm32 target\nMove dynamic plugin loading to its own optional crate\nAdd field to WindowDescriptor on wasm32 targets to optionally provide an existing canvas element as winit window\nAdjust how ArchetypeAccess tracks mutable &amp;

You can check out Quick Start Guide to get started. Bevy is also free and open source forever! You can grab the full source code on GitHub.\nHere are some of the highlights from this release:\nWASM + WebGL2\n#\n\nauthors: @mrk-its\nBevy now has a WebGL2 render backend! @mrk-its has been hard at work building the Bevy WebGL2 Plugin and expanding bevy_render to meet the needs of the web. He also put together a nice website showcasing various Bevy examples and games running on the web.\nI think the results speak for themselves:\nBevy WebGL2 Showcase\n#\n\n\nCross Platform Main Function\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\nOn most supported Bevy platforms you can just use normal main functions (ex: Windows, MacOS, Linux, and Web). Here is the smallest possible Bevy app that runs on those platforms:\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\n\nfn main() {\n    App::build().run();\n}\n\nHowever some platforms (currently Android and iOS) require additional boilerplate. This arcane magic is error prone, takes up space, and isn't particularly nice to look at. Up until this point, Bevy users had to supply their own boilerplate ... but no more! Bevy 0.4 adds a new #[bevy_main] proc-macro, which inserts the relevant boilerplate for you. This is a big step toward our \"write once run anywhere\" goal.\nThis Bevy App has all the code required to run on Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and Web:\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\n\n#[bevy_main]\nfn main() {\n    App::build().run();\n}\n\nLive Shader Reloading\n#\n\nauthors: @yrns\nBevy can now update changes to shaders at runtime, giving you instant feedback without restarting your app. This video isn't sped up!\n\nECS Improvements\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\nIt wouldn't be a Bevy update without another round of ECS improvements!\nFlexible ECS Parameters\n#\n\nPrior versions of Bevy forced you to provide system parameters in a specific order:\n/// This system followed the [Commands][Resources][Queries] order and compiled as expected\nfn valid_system(mut commands: Commands, time: Res&lt;Time&gt;, query: Query&lt;&amp;Transform&gt;) {\n}\n\n/// This system did not follow the required ordering, which caused compilation to fail\nfn invalid_system(query: Query&lt;&amp;Transform&gt;, mut commands: Commands, time: Res&lt;Time&gt;) {\n}\n\nNewbies would fall prey to this constantly. These completely arbitrary constraints were a quirk of the internal implementation. The IntoSystem trait was only implemented for specific orders. Supporting every order would have exponentially affected compile times. The internal implementation was also constructed with a famously complicated macro.\nTo resolve this, I completely rewrote how we generate systems. We now use a SystemParam trait, which we implement for each parameter type. This has a number of benefits:\n\nSignificantly Faster Compile Times: We're seeing a ~25% decrease in clean compile times\nUse Any Parameter Order You Want: No more arbitrary order restrictions!\nEasily Add New Parameters: It is now easy for us (and for users) to create new parameters. Just implement the SystemParam trait!\nSimpler Implementation: The new implementation is much smaller and also way easier to maintain and understand.\n\n// In Bevy 0.4 this system is now perfectly valid. Cool!\nfn system(query: Query&lt;&amp;Transform&gt;, commands: &amp;mut Commands, time: Res&lt;Time&gt;) {\n}\n\nNotice that in Bevy 0.4, commands now look like commands: &amp;mut Commands instead of mut commands: Commands.\nSimplified Query Filters\n#\n\nUp until now, Bevy's Query filters were intermingled with components:\nfn system(query: Query&lt;With&lt;A, Without&lt;B, (&amp;Transform, Changed&lt;Velocity&gt;)&gt;&gt;&gt;) {\n}\n\nConfused? You wouldn't be the first! You can interpret the query above as \"give me immutable references to the Transform and Velocity components of all entities that have the A component, do not have the B component, and have a changed Velocity component\".\nFirst, the nesting of types via With / Without makes it very unclear whats going on. Additionally, it's hard to tell what the Changed&lt;Velocity&gt; parameter does. Is it just a filter? Does it also return a Velocity component? If so, is it immutable or mutable?\nIt made sense to break up these concepts. In Bevy 0.4, Query filters are separate from Query components. The query above looks like this:\n// Query with filters\nfn system(query: Query&lt;(&amp;Transform, &amp;Velocity), (With&lt;A&gt;, Without&lt;B&gt;, Changed&lt;Velocity&gt;)&gt;) {\n}\n\n// Query without filters\nfn system(query: Query&lt;(&amp;Transform, &amp;Velocity)&gt;) {\n}\n\nThis makes it much easier to tell what a Query is doing at a glance. It also makes for more composable behaviors. For example, you can now filter on Changed&lt;Velocity&gt; without actually retrieving the Velocity component.\nAnd now that filters are a separate type, you can create type aliases for filters that you want to re-use:\ntype ChangedVelocity = (With&lt;A&gt;, Without&lt;B&gt;, Changed&lt;Velocity&gt;);\n\nfn system(query: Query&lt;(&amp;Transform, &amp;Velocity), ChangedVelocity&gt;) {\n}\n\nSystem Inputs, Outputs, and Chaining\n#\n\nSystems can now have inputs and outputs. This opens up a variety of interesting behaviors, such as system error handling:\nfn main() {\n  App::build()\n    .add_system(result_system.system().chain(error_handler.system()))\n    .run();\n}\n\nfn result_system(query: Query&lt;&amp;Transform&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {\n  let transform = query.get(SOME_ENTITY)?;\n  println!(\"found entity transform: {:?}\", transform);\n  Ok(())\n}\n\nfn error_handler_system(In(result): In&lt;Result&lt;()&gt;&gt;, error_handler: Res&lt;MyErrorHandler&gt;) {\n  if let Err(err) = result {\n      error_handler.handle_error(err);\n  }\n}\n\nThe \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem\n\n trait now looks like this:\n// Has no inputs and no outputs\nSystem&lt;In = (), Out = ()&gt;\n\n// Takes a usize as input and return a f32\nSystem&lt;In = usize, Out = f32&gt;\n\nWe use this feature in our new Schedule implementation.\nSchedule V2\n#\n\nBevy's old Schedule was nice. System registrations were easy to read and easy to compose. But it also had significant limitations:\n\nOnly one Schedule allowed\nVery static: you were limited to using the tools we gave you:\n\nstages are just lists of systems\nstages are added to schedules\nstages use hard-coded system runners\n\n\nCouldn't switch between schedules at runtime\nCouldn't easily support \"fixed timestep\" scenarios\n\nTo solve these problems, I wrote a new Schedule system from scratch. Before you get worried, these are largely non-breaking changes. The high level \"app builder\" syntax you know and love is still available:\napp.add_system(my_system.system())\n\nStage Trait\n#\n\nStages are now a trait. You can now implement your own \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStage\n\n types!\nstruct MyStage;\n\nimpl Stage for MyStage {\n    fn run(&amp;mut self, world: &amp;mut World, resources: &amp;mut Resources) {\n        // Do stage stuff here.\n        // You have unique access to the World and Resources, so you are free to do anything\n    }\n}\n\nStage Type: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystemStage\n\n\n#\n\nThis is basically a \"normal\" stage.

Why remove them?\n\nFor-each systems were fundamentally limited in a number of ways. They couldn't iterate removed components, filter, control iteration, or use multiple queries at the same time. This meant they needed to be converted to \"query systems\" as soon as those features were needed.\nBevy should generally have \"one way to do things\". For-each systems were a slightly more ergonomic way to define a small subset of system types. This forced people to make a \"design decision\" when they shouldn't need to. It also made examples and tutorials inconsistent according to people's preferences for one or the other.\nThere were a number of \"gotchas\" for newcomers that constantly come up in our support forums and confused newbies:\n\nusers expect &amp;mut T queries to work in foreach systems (ex: fn system(a: &amp;mut A) {}). These can't work because we require Mut&lt;T&gt; tracking pointers to ensure change tracking always works as expected. The equivalent Query&lt;&amp;mut A&gt; works because we can return the tracking pointer when iterating the Query.\nA \"run this for-each system on some criteria\" bug that was common enough that we had to cover it in the Bevy Book.\n\n\nThey increased compile times. Removing for-each systems saved me about ~5 seconds on clean Bevy compiles)\nTheir internal implementation required a complicated macro. This affected maintainability.\n\nStates\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\nBy popular demand, Bevy now supports States. These are logical \"app states\" that allow you to enable/disable systems according to the state your app is in.\nStates are defined as normal Rust enums:\n#[derive(Clone)]\nenum AppState {\n    Loading,\n    Menu,\n    InGame\n}\n\nYou then add them to your app as a resource like this:\n// add a new AppState resource that defaults to the Loading state\napp.add_resource(State::new(AppState::Loading))\n\nTo run systems according to the current state, add a \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStateStage\n\n:\napp.add_stage_after(stage::UPDATE, STAGE, StateStage::&lt;AppState&gt;::default())\n\nYou can then add systems for each state value / lifecycle-event like this:\napp\n    .on_state_enter(STAGE, AppState::Menu, setup_menu.system())\n    .on_state_update(STAGE, AppState::Menu, menu.system())\n    .on_state_exit(STAGE, AppState::Menu, cleanup_menu.system())\n    .on_state_enter(STAGE, AppState::InGame, setup_game.system())\n    .on_state_update(STAGE, AppState::InGame, movement.system())\n\nNotice that there are different \"lifecycle events\":\n\non_enter: Runs once when first entering a state\non_exit: Runs once when exiting a state\non_update: Runs exactly once on every run of the stage (after any on_enter or on_exit events have been run)\n\nYou can queue a state change from a system like this:\nfn system(mut state: ResMut&lt;State&lt;AppState&gt;&gt;) {\n    state.set_next(AppState::InGame).unwrap();\n}\n\nQueued state changes get applied at the end of the StateStage. If you change state within a StateStage, the lifecycle events will occur in the same update/frame. You can do this any number of times (aka it will continue running state lifecycle systems until no more changes are queued). This ensures that multiple state changes can be applied within the same frame.\nGLTF Improvements\n#\n\nauthors: @iwikal, @FuriouZz, @rod-salazar\nBevy's GLTF loader now imports Cameras. Here is a simple scene setup in Blender:\n\nAnd here is how it looks in Bevy (the lighting is different because we don't import lights yet):\n\nThere were also a number of other improvements:\n\nPixel format conversion while importing images from a GLTF\nDefault material loading\nHierarchy fixes\n\nSpawn Scenes as Children\n#\n\nauthors: @mockersf\nScenes can now be spawned as children like this:\ncommands\n    .spawn((\n        Transform::from_translation(Vec3::new(0.5, 0.0, 0.0)),\n        GlobalTransform::default(),\n    ))\n    .with_children(|parent| {\n        parent.spawn_scene(asset_server.load(\"scene.gltf\"));\n    });\n\nBy spawning beneath a parent, this enables you to do things like translate/rotate/scale multiple instances of the same scene:\n\nDynamic Linking\n#\n\nauthors: @bjorn3, @cart\n@bjorn3 discovered that you can force Bevy to dynamically link.\nThis significantly reduces iterative compile times. Check out how long it takes to compile a change made to the 3d_scene.rs example with the Fast Compiles Config and dynamic linking:\n\nTime To Compile Change To 3d_scene Example (in seconds, less is better)\n#\n\n\nWe added a cargo feature to easily enable dynamic linking during development\n# for a bevy app\ncargo run --features bevy/dynamic\n\n# for bevy examples\ncargo run --features dynamic --example breakout\n\nJust keep in mind that you should disable the feature when publishing your game.\nText Layout Improvements\n#\n\nauthors: @AlisCode, @tigregalis\nPrior Bevy releases used a custom, naive text layout system. It had a number of bugs and limitations, such as the infamous \"wavy text\" bug:\n\nThe new text layout system uses glyph_brush_layout, which fixes the layout bugs and adds a number of new layout options. Note that the \"Fira Sans\" font used in the example has some stylistic \"waviness\" ... this isn't a bug:\n\nRenderer Optimization\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\nBevy's render api was built to be easy to use and extend. I wanted to nail down a good api first, but that resulted in a number of performance TODOs that caused some pretty serious overhead.\nFor Bevy 0.4 I decided to resolve as many of those TODOs as I could. There is still plenty more to do (like instancing and batching), but Bevy already performs much better than it did before.\nIncrementalize Everything\n#\n\nMost of Bevy's high level render abstractions were designed to be incrementally updated, but when I was first building the engine, ECS change detection wasn't implemented. Now that we have all of these nice optimization tools, it makes sense to use them!\nFor the first optimization round, I incrementalized as much as I could:\n\nAdded change detection to RenderResourceNode, Sprites, and Transforms, which improved performance when those values don't change\nOnly sync asset gpu data when the asset changes\nShare asset RenderResourceBindings across all entities that reference an asset\nMesh provider system now only updates mesh specialization when it needs to\nStop clearing bind groups every frame and remove stale bind groups every other frame\nCache unmatched render resource binding results (which prevents redundant computations per-entity per-frame)\nDon't send render pass state change commands when the state has not actually changed\n\nFrame Time to Draw 10,000 Static Sprites (in milliseconds, less is better)\n#\n\n\nFrame Time to Draw 10,000 Moving Sprites (in milliseconds, less is better)\n#\n\n\nOptimize Text Rendering (and other immediate rendering)\n#\n\nText Rendering (and anything else that used the SharedBuffers immediate-rendering abstraction) was extremely slow in prior Bevy releases. This was because the SharedBuffers abstraction was a placeholder implementation that didn't actually share buffers. By implementing the \"real\" SharedBuffers abstraction, we got a pretty significant text rendering speed boost.\nFrame Time to Draw \"text_debug\" Example  (in milliseconds, less is better)\n#\n\n\nMailbox Vsync\n#\n\nBevy now uses wgpu's \"mailbox vsync\" by default. This reduces input latency on platforms that support it.\nReflection\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\nRust has a pretty big \"reflection\" gap. For those who aren't aware, \"reflection\" is a class of language feature that enables you to interact with language constructs at runtime. They add a form of \"dynamic-ness\" to what are traditionally static language concepts.\nWe have bits and pieces of reflection in Rust, such as \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstd::any::TypeId\n\n and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstd::any::type_name\n\n. But when it comes to interacting with datatypes ... we don't have anything yet. This is unfortunate because some problems are inherently dynamic in nature.\nWhen I was first building Bevy, I decided that the engine would benefit from such features. Reflection is a good foundation for scene systems, Godot-like (or Unity-like) property animation systems, and editor inspection tools. I built the bevy_property and bevy_type_registry crates to fill these needs.\nThey got the job done, but they were custom-tailored to Bevy's needs, were full of custom jargon (rather than reflecting Rust language constructs directly), didn't handle traits, and had a number of fundamental restrictions on how data could be accessed.\nIn this release we replaced the old bevy_property and bevy_type_registry crates with a new \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbevy_reflect\n crate. Bevy Reflect is intended to be a \"generic\" Rust reflection crate. I'm hoping it will be as useful for non-Bevy projects as it is for Bevy. We now use it for our Scene system, but in the future we will use it for animating Component fields and auto-generating Bevy Editor inspector widgets.\nBevy Reflect enables you to dynamically interact with Rust types by deriving the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflect\n\n trait:\n#[derive(Reflect)]\nstruct Foo {\n    a: u32,\n    b: Vec&lt;Bar&gt;,\n    c: Vec&lt;u32&gt;,\n}\n\n#[derive(Reflect)]\nstruct Bar {\n    value: String\n}\n\n// I'll use this value to illustrate `bevy_reflect` features\nlet mut foo = Foo {\n    a: 1,\n    b: vec![Bar { value: \"hello world\" }]\n    c: vec![1, 2]\n};\n\nInteract with Fields Using Their Names\n#\n\nassert_eq!(*foo.get_field::&lt;u32&gt;(\"a\").unwrap(), 1);\n\n*foo.get_field_mut::&lt;u32&gt;(\"a\").unwrap() = 2;\n\nassert_eq!(foo.a, 2);\n\nPatch Your Types With New Values\n#\n\nlet mut dynamic_struct = DynamicStruct::default();\ndynamic_struct.insert(\"a\", 42u32);\ndynamic_struct.insert(\"c\", vec![3, 4, 5]);\n\nfoo.apply(&amp;dynamic_struct);\n\nassert_eq!(foo.a, 42);\nassert_eq!(foo.c, vec![3, 4, 5]);\n\nLook Up Nested Fields Using \"Path Strings\"\n#\n\nlet value = *foo.get_path::&lt;String&gt;(\"b[0].value\").unwrap();\nassert_eq!(value.as_str(), \"hello world\");\n\nIterate Over Struct Fields\n#\n\nfor (i, value: &amp;Reflect) in foo.iter_fields().enumerate() {\n    let field_name = foo.name_at(i).unwrap();\n    if let Ok(value) = value.downcast_ref::&lt;u32&gt;() {\n        println!(\"{} is a u32 with the value: {}\", field_name, *value);\n    } \n}\n\nAutomatically Serialize And Deserialize With Serde\n#\n\nThis doesn't require manual Serde impls!\nlet mut registry = TypeRegistry::default();\nregistry.register::&lt;u32&gt;();\nregistry.register::&lt;String&gt;();\nregistry.register::&lt;Bar&gt;();\n\nlet serializer = ReflectSerializer::new(&amp;foo, &amp;registry);\nlet serialized = ron::ser::to_string_pretty(&amp;serializer, ron::ser::PrettyConfig::default()).unwrap();\n\nlet mut deserializer = ron::de::Deserializer::from_str(&amp;serialized).unwrap();\nlet reflect_deserializer = ReflectDeserializer::new(&amp;registry);\nlet value = reflect_deserializer.deserialize(&amp;mut deserializer).unwrap();\nlet dynamic_struct = value.take::&lt;DynamicStruct&gt;().unwrap();\n\n/// reflect has its own partal_eq impl\nassert!(foo.reflect_partial_eq(&amp;dynamic_struct).unwrap());\n\nTrait Reflection\n#\n\nYou can now call a trait on a given &amp;dyn Reflect reference without knowing the underlying type! This is a form of magic that should probably be avoided in most situations. But in the few cases where it is completely necessary, it is very useful:\n#[derive(Reflect)]\n#[reflect(DoThing)]\nstruct MyType {\n    value: String,\n}\n\nimpl DoThing for MyType {\n    fn do_thing(&amp;self) -&gt; String {\n        format!(\"{} World!\", self.value)\n    }\n}\n\n#[reflect_trait]\npub trait DoThing {\n    fn do_thing(&amp;self) -&gt; String;\n}\n\n// First, lets box our type as a Box&lt;dyn Reflect&gt;\nlet reflect_value: Box&lt;dyn Reflect&gt; = Box::new(MyType {\n    value: \"Hello\".to_string(),\n});\n\n/* \nThis means we no longer have direct access to MyType or it methods. We can only call Reflect methods on reflect_value. What if we want to call `do_thing` on our type? We could downcast using reflect_value.get::&lt;MyType&gt;(), but what if we don't know the type at compile time?\n*/\n\n// Normally in rust we would be out of luck at this point. Lets use our new reflection powers to do something cool!\nlet mut type_registry = TypeRegistry::default()\ntype_registry.register::&lt;MyType&gt;();\n\n/*\nThe #[reflect] attribute we put on our DoThing trait generated a new `ReflectDoThing` struct, which implements TypeData. This was added to MyType's TypeRegistration.\n*/\n\nlet reflect_do_thing = type_registry\n    .get_type_data::&lt;ReflectDoThing&gt;(reflect_value.type_id())\n    .unwrap();\n\n// We can use this generated type to convert our `&amp;dyn Reflect` reference to an `&amp;dyn DoThing` reference\nlet my_trait: &amp;dyn DoThing = reflect_do_thing.get(&amp;*reflect_value).unwrap();\n\n// Which means we can now call do_thing(). Magic!\nprintln!(\"{}\", my_trait.do_thing());\n\n3D Texture Assets\n#\n\nauthors: @bonsairobo\nThe Texture asset now has support for 3D textures. The new array_texture.rs example illustrates how to load a 3d texture and sample from each \"layer\".\n\nLogging and Profiling\n#\n\nauthors: @superdump, @cart\nBevy finally has built in logging, which is now enabled by default via the new \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogPlugin\n\n. We evaluated various logging libraries and eventually landed on the new tracing crate. tracing is a structured logger that handles async / parallel logging well (perfect for an engine like Bevy), and enables profiling in addition to \"normal\" logging.\nThe \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogPlugin\n\n configures each platform to log to the appropriate backend by default: the terminal on desktop, the console on web, and Android Logs / logcat on Android. We built a new Android tracing backend because one didn't exist yet.\nLogging\n#\n\nBevy's internal plugins now generate tracing logs. And you can easily add logs to your own app logic like this:\n// these are imported by default in bevy::prelude::*\ntrace!(\"very noisy\");\ndebug!(\"helpful for debugging\");\ninfo!(\"helpful information that is worth printing by default\");\nwarn!(\"something bad happened that isn't a failure, but thats worth calling out\");\nerror!(\"something failed\");\n\nThese lines result in pretty-printed terminal logs:\n\ntracing has a ton of useful features like structured logging and filtering. Check out their documentation for more info.\nProfiling\n#\n\nWe have added the option to add \"tracing spans\" to all ECS systems by enabling the trace feature. We also have built in support for the tracing-chrome extension, which causes Bevy to output traces in the \"chrome tracing\" format.\nIf you run your app with cargo run --features bevy/trace,bevy/trace_chrome you will get a json file which can be opened in Chrome browsers by visiting the chrome://tracing url:\n\n@superdump added support for those nice \"span names\" to upstream tracing_chrome.\nHIDPI\n#\n\nauthors: @mockersf, @blunted2night, @cart\nBevy now handles HIDPI / Retina / high pixel density displays properly:\n\nOS-reported pixel density is now taken into account when creating windows. If a Bevy App asks for a 1280x720 window on a 2x pixel density display, it will create a window that is 2560x1440\nWindow width/height is now reported in \"logical units\" (1280x720 in the example above). Physical units are still available using the window.physical_width() and window.physical_height() methods.\nWindow \"swap chains\" are created using the physical resolution to ensure we still have crisp rendering (2560x1440 in the example above)\nBevy UI has been adapted to handle HIDPI scaling correctly\n\nThere is still a bit more work to be done here. While Bevy UI renders images and boxes at crisp HIDPI resolutions, text is still rendered using the logical resolution, which means it won't be as crisp as it could be on HIDPI displays.\nTimer Improvements\n#\n\nauthors: @amberkowalski, @marcusbuffett, @CleanCut\nBevy's Timer component/resource got a number of quality-of-life improvements: pausing, field accessor methods, ergonomics improvements, and internal refactoring / code quality improvements. Timer Components also no longer tick by default. Timer resources and newtyped Timer components couldn't tick by default, so it was a bit inconsistent to have the (relatively uncommon) \"unwrapped component Timer\" auto-tick.\nThe timer api now looks like this:\n\nstruct MyTimer {\n    timer: Timer,\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    App::build()\n        .add_resource(MyTimer {\n            // a five second non-repeating timer\n            timer: Timer::from_seconds(5.0, false),\n        })\n        .add_system(timer_system.system())\n        .run();\n}\n\n\nfn timer_system(time: Res&lt;Time&gt;, my_timer: ResMut&lt;MyTimer&gt;) {\n    if my_timer.timer.tick(time.delta_seconds()).just_finished() {\n        println!(\"five seconds have passed\");\n    }\n}\n\nTask System Improvements\n#\n\nauthors: @aclysma\n@aclysma changed how Bevy Tasks schedules work, which increased performance in the breakout.rs example game by ~20% and resolved a deadlock when a Task Pool is configured to only have one thread. Tasks are now executed on the calling thread immediately when there is only one task to run, which cuts down on the overhead of moving work to other threads / blocking on them to finish.\nApple Silicon Support\n#\n\nauthors: @frewsxcv, @wyhaya, @scoopr\nBevy now runs on Apple silicon thanks to upstream work on winit (@scoopr) and coreaudio-sys (@wyhaya). @frewsxcv and @wyhaya updated Bevy's dependencies and verified that it builds/runs on Apple's new chips.\nNew Examples\n#\n\nBevy Contributors\n#\n\nauthor: @karroffel\n@karroffel added a fun example that represents each Bevy contributor as a \"Bevy Bird\".

You can check out Quick Start Guide to get started. Bevy is also free and open source forever! You can grab the full source code on GitHub. Check out Awesome Bevy for a list of community-developed plugins, games, and learning resources.\nBevy 0.5 is quite a bit bigger than our past few releases (and took a bit longer) as we have made a number of foundational changes. If you plan on updating your App or Plugin to Bevy 0.5, check out our 0.4 to 0.5 Migration Guide.\nHere are some of the highlights from this release:\nPhysically Based Rendering (PBR)\n#\n\nauthors: @StarArawn, @mtsr, @mockersf, @IngmarBitter, @Josh015, @norgate, @cart\nBevy now uses PBR shaders when rendering. PBR is a semi-standard approach to rendering that attempts to use approximations of real-world \"physically based\" lighting and material properties. We largely use techniques from the Filament PBR implementation, but we also incorporate some ideas from Unreal and Disney.\nBevy's StandardMaterial now has base_color, roughness, metallic, reflection, and emissive properties. It also now supports textures for base_color, normal_map, metallic_roughness, emissive, and occlusion properties.\nThe new PBR example helps visualize these new material properties:\n\nGLTF Improvements\n#\n\nPBR Textures\n#\n\nauthors: @mtsr, @mockersf\nThe GLTF loader now supports normal maps, metallic/roughness, occlusion, and emissive textures. Our \"flight helmet\" gltf example utilizes the new PBR texture support and looks much nicer as a result:\n\nTop-Level GLTF Asset\n#\n\nauthors: @mockersf\nPreviously it was hard to interact with GLTF assets because scenes / meshes / textures / and materials were only loaded as \"sub assets\". Thanks to the new top level \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGltf\n\n asset type, it is now possible to navigate the contents of the GLTF asset:\n// load GLTF asset on startup\nfn setup(mut commands: Commands, assets: Res&lt;AssetServer&gt;) {\n    let handle = assets.load(\"flight_helmet.gltf\");\n    commands.insert_resource(handle);\n}\n\n// access GLTF asset at some later point in time\nfn system(handle: Res&lt;Handle&lt;Gltf&gt;&gt;, gltfs: Res&lt;Assets&lt;Gltf&gt;&gt;, materials: Res&lt;Assets&lt;StandardMaterial&gt;&gt;) {\n    let gltf = gltfs.get(&amp;handle).unwrap();\n    let material_handle = gltf.named_materials.get(\"MetalPartsMat\").unwrap();\n    let material = materials.get(material_handle).unwrap();\n}\n\nBevy ECS V2\n#\n\nThis release marks a huge step forward for Bevy's ECS. It has significant implications for how Bevy Apps are composed and how well they perform:\n\nA full rewrite of the ECS core:\n\nMassively improved performance across the board\n\"Hybrid\" component storage\nAn \"Archetype Graph\" for faster archetype changes\nStateful queries that cache results across runs\n\n\nA brand new parallel System executor:\n\nSupport for explicit system ordering\nSystem Labels\nSystem Sets\nImproved system \"run criteria\"\nIncreased system parallelism\n\n\n\"Reliable\" change detection:\n\nSystems will now always detect component changes, even across frames\n\n\nA rewrite of the State system:\n\nA much more natural \"stack-based state machine\" model\nDirect integration with the new scheduler\nImproved \"state lifecycle\" events\n\n\n\nRead on for the details!\nECS Core Rewrite\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\nUp until this point, Bevy used a heavily forked version of hecs for our ECS core. Since Bevy's first release, we've learned a lot about Bevy's ECS needs. We've also collaborated with other ECS project leaders, such as Sander Mertens (lead flecs developer) and Gijs-Jan Roelofs (Xenonauts ECS framework developer). As an \"ECS community\", we've started to zero in on what the future of ECS could be.\nBevy ECS v2 is our first step into that future. It also means that Bevy ECS is no longer a \"hecs fork\". We are going out on our own!\nComponent Storage (The Problem)\n#\n\nTwo ECS storage paradigms have gained a lot of traction over the years:\n\nArchetypal ECS:\n\nStores components in \"tables\" with static schemas. Each \"column\" stores components of a given type. Each \"row\" is an entity.\nEach \"archetype\" has its own table. Adding/removing an entity's component changes the archetype.\nEnables super-fast Query iteration due to its cache-friendly data layout\nComes at the cost of more expensive add/remove operations for an Entity's components, because all components need to be copied to the new archetype's \"table\"\nParallelism-friendly: entities only exist in one archetype at a time so systems that access the same components but in different archetypes can run in parallel\nFrameworks: Old Bevy ECS, hecs, legion, flecs, Unity DOTS\n\n\nSparse Set ECS:\n\nStores components of the same type in densely packed arrays, which are sparsely indexed by densely packed unsigned integers (entity ids)\nQuery iteration is slower than Archetypal ECS (by default) because each entity's component could be at any position in the sparse set. This \"random access\" pattern isn't cache friendly. Additionally, there is an extra layer of indirection because you must first map the entity id to an index in the component array.\nAdding/removing components is a cheap, constant time operation\n\"Component Packs\" are used to optimize iteration performance on a case by case basis (but packs conflict with each other)\nLess parallelism friendly: systems need to either lock a whole component storage (not granular) or individual entities (expensive)\nFrameworks: Shipyard, EnTT\n\n\n\nDevelopers selecting an ECS framework are stuck with a hard choice. Select an \"archetypal\" framework with \"fast iteration everywhere\" but without the ability to cheaply add/remove components, or select a \"sparse set\" framework to cheaply add/remove components but with slower iteration performance or manual (and conflicting) pack optimizations.\nHybrid Component Storage (The Solution)\n#\n\nIn Bevy ECS V2, we get to have our cake and eat it too. It now has both of the component storage types above (and more can be added later if needed):\n\nTables (aka \"archetypal\" storage in other frameworks)\n\nThe default storage. If you don't configure anything, this is what you get\nFast iteration by default\nSlower add/remove operations\n\n\nSparse Sets\n\nOpt-in\nSlower iteration\nFaster add/remove operations\n\n\n\nThese storage types complement each other perfectly. By default Query iteration is fast. If developers know that they want to add/remove a component at high frequencies, they can set the storage to \"sparse set\":\napp.register_component(\n    ComponentDescriptor::new::&lt;MyComponent&gt;(StorageType::SparseSet)\n);\n\nComponent Add/Remove Benchmark (in milliseconds, less is better)\n#\n\nThis benchmark illustrates adding and removing a single 4x4 matrix component 10,000 times from an entity that has 5 other 4x4 matrix components. The \"other\" components are included to help illustrate the cost of \"table storage\" (used by Bevy 0.4, Bevy 0.5 (Table), and Legion), which requires moving the \"other\" components to a new table.\n\nYou may have noticed that Bevy 0.5 (Table) is also way faster than Bevy 0.4, even though they both use \"table storage\". This is largely a result of the new Archetype Graph, which significantly cuts the cost of archetype changes.\nStateful Queries and System Parameters\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n queries (and other system parameters) are now stateful. This allows us to:\n\nCache archetype (and table) matches\n\nThis resolves another issue with (naive) archetypal ECS: query performance getting worse as the number of archetypes goes up (and fragmentation occurs).\n\n\nCache Query Fetch and Filter state\n\nThe expensive parts of fetch/filter operations (such as hashing the TypeId to find the ComponentId) now only happen once when the Query is first constructed\n\n\nIncrementally build up state\n\nWhen new archetypes are added, we only process the new archetypes (no need to rebuild state for old archetypes)\n\n\n\nAs a result, the direct \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n query api now looks like this:\nlet mut query = world.query::&lt;(&amp;A, &amp;mut B)&gt;();\nfor (a, mut b) in query.iter_mut(&amp;mut world) {\n}\n\nHowever for \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystems\n\n  this is a non-breaking change. Query state management is done internally by the relevant SystemParam.\nWe have achieved some pretty significant performance wins as a result of the new Query system.\n\"Sparse\" Fragmented Iterator Benchmark (in nanoseconds, less is better)\n#\n\nThis benchmark runs a query that matches 5 entities within a single archetype and doesn't match 100 other archetypes. This is a reasonable test of \"real world\" queries in games, which generally have many different entity \"types\", most of which don't match a given query. This test uses \"table storage\" across the board.\n\nBevy 0.5 marks a huge improvement for cases like this, thanks to the new \"stateful queries\". Bevy 0.4 needs to check every archetype each time the iterator is run, whereas Bevy 0.5 amortizes that cost to zero.\nFragmented Iterator Benchmark (in milliseconds, less is better)\n#\n\nThis is the ecs_bench_suite frag_iter benchmark. It runs a query on 27 archetypes with 20 entities each. However unlike the \"Sparse Fragmented Iterator Benchmark\", there are no \"unmatched\" archetypes. This test uses \"table storage\" across the board.\n\nThe gains here compared to the last benchmark are smaller because there aren't any unmatched archetypes. However Bevy 0.5 still gets a nice boost due to better iterator/query impls, amortizing the cost of matched archetypes to zero, and for_each iterators.\nUber Fast \"for_each\" Query Iterators\n#\n\nDevelopers now have the choice to use a fast \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuery::for_each()\n\n iterator, which yields ~1.5-3x iteration speed improvements for \"fragmented iteration\", and minor ~1.2x iteration speed improvements for unfragmented iteration.\nfn system(query: Query&lt;(&amp;A, &amp;mut B)&gt;) {\n    // you now have the option to do this for a speed boost\n    query.for_each_mut(|(a, mut b)| {\n    });\n\n    // however normal iterators are still available\n    for (a, mut b) in query.iter_mut() {\n    }\n}\n\nWe will continue to encourage \"normal\" iterators as they are more flexible and more \"rust idiomatic\". But when that extra \"oomf\" is needed, for_each will be there ... waiting for you :)\nNew Parallel System Executor\n#\n\nauthors: @Ratysz\nBevy's old parallel executor had a number of fundamental limitations:\n\nThe only way to explicitly define system order was to create new stages. This was both boilerplate-ey and prevented parallelism (because stages run \"one by one\" in order). We've noticed that system ordering is a common requirement and stages just weren't cutting it.\nSystems had \"implicit\" orderings when they accessed conflicting resources. These orderings were hard to reason about.\nThe \"implicit orderings\" produced execution strategies that often left a lot of parallelism potential on the table.\n\nFortunately @Ratysz has been doing a lot of research in this area and volunteered to contribute a new executor. The new executor solves all of the issues above and also adds a bunch of new usability improvements. The \"ordering\" rules are now dead-simple:\n\nSystems run in parallel by default\nSystems with explicit orderings defined will respect those orderings\n\nExplicit System Dependencies and System Labels\n#\n\nauthors: @Ratysz, @TheRawMeatball\nSystems can now be assigned one or more \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystemLabels\n\n. These labels can then be referenced by other systems (within a stage) to run before or after systems with that label:\napp\n    .add_system(update_velocity.system().label(\"velocity\"))\n    // The \"movement\" system will run after \"update_velocity\" \n    .add_system(movement.system().after(\"velocity\"))\n\nThis produces an equivalent ordering, but it uses before() instead.\napp\n    // The \"update_velocity\" system will run before \"movement\" \n    .add_system(update_velocity.system().before(\"movement\"))\n    .add_system(movement.system().label(\"movement\"));\n\nAny type that implements the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystemLabel\n\n trait can be used. In most cases we recommend defining custom types and deriving \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystemLabel\n\n for them. This prevents typos, allows for encapsulation (when needed), and allows IDEs to autocomplete labels:\n#[derive(Debug, Hash, PartialEq, Eq, Clone, SystemLabel)]\npub enum PhysicsSystem {\n    UpdateVelocity,\n    Movement,\n}\n\napp\n    .add_system(update_velocity.system().label(PhysicsSystem::UpdateVelocity))\n    .add_system(movement.system()\n        .label(PhysicsSystem::Movement)\n        .after(PhysicsSystem::UpdateVelocity)\n    );\n\nMany-to-Many System Labels\n#\n\nMany-to-many labels is a powerful concept that makes it easy to take a dependency on many systems that produce a given behavior/outcome. For example, if you have a system that needs to run after all \"physics\" has finished updating (see the example above), you could label all \"physics systems\" with the same Physics label:\n#[derive(Debug, Hash, PartialEq, Eq, Clone, SystemLabel)]\npub struct Physics;\n\n#[derive(Debug, Hash, PartialEq, Eq, Clone, SystemLabel)]\npub enum PhysicsSystem {\n    UpdateVelocity,\n    Movement,\n}\n\napp\n    .add_system(update_velocity.system()\n        .label(PhysicsSystem::UpdateVelocity)\n        .label(Physics)\n    )\n    .add_system(movement.system()\n        .label(PhysicsSystem::Movement)\n        .label(Physics)\n        .after(PhysicsSystem::UpdateVelocity)\n    )\n    .add_system(runs_after_physics.system().after(Physics));\n\nBevy plugin authors should export labels like this in their public APIs to enable their users to insert systems before/after logic provided by the plugin.\nSystem Sets\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystemSets\n\n are a new way to apply the same configuration to a group of systems, which significantly cuts down on boilerplate. The \"physics\" example above could be rephrased like this:\napp\n    .add_system_set(SystemSet::new()\n        // this label is added to all systems in the set\n        .label(Physics)\n        .with_system(update_velocity.system().label(PhysicsSystem::UpdateVelocity))\n        .with_system(movement.system()\n            .label(PhysicsSystem::Movement)\n            .after(PhysicsSystem::UpdateVelocity)\n        )\n    )\n\nSystemSets can also use before(Label) and after(Label) to run all systems in the set before/after the given label.\nThis is also very useful for groups of systems that need to run with the same \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunCriteria\n\n.\napp\n    // all systems in this set will run once every two seconds\n    .add_system_set(SystemSet::new()\n        .with_run_criteria(FixedTimestep::step(2.0))\n        .with_system(foo.system())\n        .with_system(bar.system())\n    )\n\nImproved Run Criteria\n#\n\nRun Criteria are now decoupled from systems and will be re-used when possible. For example, the FixedTimestep criteria in the example above will only be run once per stage run. The executor will re-use the criteria's result for both the foo and bar system.\nRun Criteria can now also be labeled and referenced by other systems:\nfn every_other_time(mut has_ran: Local&lt;bool&gt;) -&gt; ShouldRun {\n    *has_ran = !*has_ran;\n    if *has_ran {\n        ShouldRun::Yes\n    } else {\n        ShouldRun::No\n    }\n}\n\napp.add_stage(SystemStage::parallel()\n   .with_system_run_criteria(every_other_time.system().label(\"every_other_time\")))\n   .add_system(foo.system().with_run_criteria(\"every_other_time\"))\n\nResults from Run Criteria can also be \"piped\" into other criteria, which enables interesting composed behaviors:\nfn once_in_a_blue_moon(In(input): In&lt;ShouldRun&gt;, moon: Res&lt;Moon&gt;) -&gt; ShouldRun {\n    if moon.is_blue() {\n        input\n    } else {\n        ShouldRun::No\n    }\n}\n\napp\n    .add_system(foo.with_run_criteria(\n        \"every_other_time\".pipe(once_in_a_blue_moon.system())\n    )\n\nAmbiguity Detection and Resolution\n#\n\nWhile the new executor is now much easier to reason about, it does introduce a new class of error: \"system order ambiguities\". When two systems interact with the same data, but have no explicit ordering defined, the output they produce is non-deterministic (and often not what the author intended).\nConsider the following app:\nfn increment_counter(mut counter: ResMut&lt;usize&gt;) {\n    *counter += 1;\n}\n\nfn print_every_other_time(counter: Res&lt;usize&gt;) {\n    if *counter % 2 == 0 {\n        println!(\"ran\");\n    }\n}\n\napp\n    .add_system(increment_counter.system())\n    .add_system(print_every_other_time.system())\n\nThe author clearly intended print_every_other_time to run every other update. However, due to the fact that these systems have no order defined, they could run in a different order each update and create a situation where nothing is printed over the course of two updates:\nUPDATE\n- increment_counter (counter now equals 1)\n- print_every_other_time (nothing printed)\nUPDATE\n- print_every_other_time (nothing printed)\n- increment_counter (counter now equals 2)\n\nThe old executor would have implicitly forced increment_counter to run first because it conflicts with print_every_other_time and it was inserted first. But the new executor requires you to be explicit here (which we believe is a good thing).\nTo help detect this class of error, we built an opt-in tool that detects these ambiguities and logs them:\n// add this resource to your App to enable ambiguity detection\napp.insert_resource(ReportExecutionOrderAmbiguities)\n\nThen when we run our App, we will see the following message printed to our terminal:\nExecution order ambiguities detected, you might want to add an explicit dependency relation between some of these systems:\n * Parallel systems:\n -- \"&amp;app::increment_counter\" and \"&amp;app::print_every_other_time\"\n    conflicts: [\"usize\"]\n\nThe ambiguity detector found a conflict and mentions that adding an explicit dependency would resolve the conflict:\napp\n    .add_system(increment_counter.system().label(\"increment\"))\n    .add_system(print_every_other_time.system().after(\"increment\"))\n\nThere are some cases where ambiguities are not a bug, such as operations on unordered collection like Assets. This is why we don't enable the detector by default. You are free to just ignore these ambiguities, but if you want to suppress the messages in the detector (without defining a dependency), you can add your systems to an \"ambiguity set\":\napp\n    .add_system(a.system().in_ambiguity_set(\"foo\"))\n    .add_system(b.system().in_ambiguity_set(\"foo\"))\n\nI want to stress that this is totally optional. Bevy code should be ergonomic and \"fun\" to write. If sprinkling ambiguity sets everywhere isn't your cup of tea, just don't worry about it!\nWe are also actively seeking feedback on the new executor. We believe that the new implementation is easier to understand and encourages self-documenting code. The improved parallelism is also nice! But we want to hear from users (both new users starting fresh and old users porting their codebases to the new executor). This space is all about design tradeoffs and feedback will help us ensure we made the right calls.\nReliable change detection\n#\n\nauthors: @Davier, @bjorn3, @alice-i-cecile, @cart\nGlobal change detection, the ability to run queries on the Changed/Added status of any ECS component or resource, just got a major usability boost: changes are now detected across frames/updates:\n// This is still the same change detection api we all know and love,\n// the only difference is that it \"just works\" in every situation.\nfn system(query: Query&lt;Entity, Changed&lt;A&gt;&gt;) {\n    // iterates all entities whose A component has changed since\n    // the last run of this system \n    for e in query.iter() {\n    }\n}\n\nGlobal change detection was already a feature that set Bevy apart from other ECS frameworks, but now it is completely \"fool proof\". It works as expected regardless of system ordering, stage membership, or system run criteria.\nThe old behavior was \"systems detect changes that ocurred in systems that ran before them this frame\". This was because we used a bool to track when each component/resource is added/modified. This flag was cleared for each component at the end of the frame. As a result, users had to be very careful about order of operations, and using features like \"system run criteria\" could result in dropped changes if systems didn't run on a given update.\nWe now use a clever \"world tick\" design that allows systems to detect changes that happened at any point in time since their last run.\nStates V2\n#\n\nauthors: @TheRawMeatball\nThe last Bevy release added States, which enabled developers to run groups of ECS systems according to the value of a State&lt;T&gt; resource. Systems could be run according to \"state lifecycle events\", such as on_enter, on_update, and on_exit. States make things like separate \"loading screen\" and \"in game\" logic easier to encode in Bevy ECS.\nThe old implementation largely worked, but it had a number of quirks and limitations. First and foremost, it required adding a new StateStage, which cut down on parallelism, increased boilerplate, and forced ordering where it wasn't required. Additionally, some of the lifecycle events didn't always behave as expected.\nThe new \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState\n\n implementation is built on top of the new parallel executor's SystemSet and RunCriteria features, for a much more natural, flexible, and parallel api that builds on existing concepts instead of creating new ones:\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, Eq, PartialEq, Hash)]\nenum AppState {\n    Menu,\n    InGame,\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    App::build()\n        .add_state(AppState::Menu)\n        .add_system_set(SystemSet::on_enter(AppState::Menu).with_system(setup_menu.system()))\n        .add_system_set(SystemSet::on_update(AppState::Menu).with_system(menu_logic.system()))\n        .add_system_set(SystemSet::on_exit(AppState::Menu).with_system(cleanup_menu.system()))\n        .add_system_set(SystemSet::on_enter(AppState::InGame).with_system(setup_game.system()))\n        .add_system_set(\n            SystemSet::on_update(AppState::InGame)\n                .with_system(game_logic.system())\n                .with_system(more_game_logic.system())\n        )\n        .run();\n}\n\nStates now use a \"stack-based state machine\" model. This opens up a number of options for state transitions:\nfn system(mut state: ResMut&lt;State&lt;AppState&gt;&gt;) {\n    // Queues up a state change that pushes a new state on to the\n    // stack (preserving previous states)\n    state.push(AppState::InGame).unwrap();\n\n    // Queues up a state change that removes the current state on\n    // the stack and reverts to the previous state\n    state.pop().unwrap();\n\n    // Queues up a state change that overwrites the current state at\n    // the \"top\" of the stack\n    state.set(AppState::InGame).unwrap();\n\n    // Queues up a state change that replaces the entire stack of states\n    state.replace(AppState::InGame).unwrap();\n}\n\nJust like the old implementation, state changes are applied in the same frame. This means it is possible to transition from states A-&gt;B-&gt;C and run the relevant state lifecycle events without skipping frames. This builds on top of \"looping run criteria\", which we also use for our \"fixed timestep\" implementation (and which you can use for your own run criteria logic).\nEvent Ergonomics\n#\n\nauthors: @TheRawMeatball\nEvents now have a first-class shorthand syntax for easier consumption:\n// Old Bevy 0.4 syntax\nfn system(mut reader: Local&lt;EventReader&lt;SomeEvent&gt;&gt;, events: Res&lt;Events&lt;SomeEvent&gt;&gt;) {\n    for event in reader.iter(&amp;events) {\n    }\n}\n\n// New Bevy 0.5 syntax\nfn system(mut reader: EventReader&lt;SomeEvent&gt;) {\n    for event in reader.iter() {\n    }\n}\n\nThere is also now a symmetrical EventWriter api:\nfn system(mut writer: EventWriter&lt;SomeEvent&gt;) {\n    writer.send(SomeEvent { ... })\n}\n\nThe old \"manual\" approach is still possible via ManualEventReader:\nfn system(mut reader: Local&lt;ManualEventReader&lt;SomeEvent&gt;&gt;, events: Res&lt;Events&lt;SomeEvent&gt;&gt;) {\n    for event in reader.iter(&amp;events) {\n    }\n}\n\nRich Text\n#\n\nauthors: @tigregalis\nText can now have \"sections\", each with their own style / formatting. This makes text much more flexible, while still respecting the text layout rules:\n\nThis is accomplished using the new \"text section\" api:\ncommands\n    .spawn_bundle(TextBundle {\n        text: Text {\n            sections: vec![\n                TextSection {\n                    value: \"FPS: \".to_string(),\n                    style: TextStyle {\n                        font: asset_server.load(\"FiraSans-Bold.ttf\"),\n                        font_size: 90.0,\n                        color: Color::WHITE,\n                    },\n                },\n                TextSection {\n                    value: \"60.03\".to_string(),\n                    style: TextStyle {\n                        font: asset_server.load(\"FiraMono-Medium.ttf\"),\n                        font_size: 90.0,\n                        color: Color::GOLD,\n                    },\n                },\n            ],\n            ..Default::default()\n        },\n        ..Default::default()\n    })\n\nHIDPI Text\n#\n\nauthors: @blunted2night\nText is now rendered according to the current monitor's scale factor. This gives nice, crisp text at any resolution.\n\nRender Text in 2D World Space\n#\n\nauthors: @CleanCut, @blunted2night\nText can now be spawned into 2D scenes using the new Text2dBundle. This makes it easier to do things like \"draw names above players\".\n\nWorld To Screen Coordinate Conversions\n#\n\nauthors: @aevyrie\nIt is now possible to convert world coordinates to a given camera's screen coordinates using the new Camera::world_to_screen() function. Here is an example of this feature being used to position a UI element on top of a moving 3d object.\n\n3D Orthographic Camera\n#\n\nauthors: @jamadazi\nOrthographic cameras can now be used in 3D! This is useful for things like CAD applications and isometric games.\n\nOrthographic Camera Scaling Modes\n#\n\nauthors: @jamadazi\nPrior to Bevy 0.5, Bevy's orthographic camera had only one mode: \"window scaling\". It would adapt the projection according to the vertical and horizontal size of the window. This works for some styles of games, but other games need arbitrary window-independent scale factors or scale factors defined by either horizontal or vertical window sizes.\nBevy 0.5 adds a new ScalingMode option to OrthographicCamera, which enables developers to customize how the projection is calculated.\nIt also adds the ability to \"zoom\" the camera using OrthographicProjection::scale.\nFlexible Camera Bindings\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\nBevy used to \"hack in\" camera bindings for each RenderGraph PassNode. This worked when there was only one binding type (the combined ViewProj matrix), but many shaders require other camera properties, such as the world space position.\nIn Bevy 0.5 we removed the \"hack\" in favor of the RenderResourceBindings system used elsewhere. This enables shaders to bind arbitrary camera data (with any set or binding index) and only pull in the data they need.\nThe new PBR shaders take advantage of this feature, but custom shaders can also use it.\nlayout(set = 0, binding = 0) uniform CameraViewProj {\n    mat4 ViewProj;\n};\nlayout(set = 0, binding = 1) uniform CameraPosition {\n    vec3 CameraPos;\n};\n\nRender Layers\n#\n\nauthors: @schell\nSometimes you don't want a camera to draw everything in a scene, or you want to temporarily hide a set of things in the scene. Bevy 0.5 adds a RenderLayer system, which gives developers the ability to add entities to layers by adding the RenderLayers component.\nCameras can also have a \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRenderLayers\n\n component, which determines what layers they can see.\n// spawn a sprite on layer 0\ncommands\n    .spawn_bundle(SpriteBundle {\n        material: materials.add(Color::rgb(1.0, 0.5, 0.5).into()),\n        transform: Transform::from_xyz(0.0, -50.0, 1.0),\n        sprite: Sprite::new(Vec2::new(30.0, 30.0)),\n    })\n    .insert(RenderLayers::layer(0));\n// spawn a sprite on layer 1\ncommands\n    .spawn_bundle(SpriteBundle {\n        material: materials.add(Color::rgb(1.0, 0.5, 0.5).into()),\n        transform: Transform::from_xyz(0.0, -50.0, 1.0),\n        sprite: Sprite::new(Vec2::new(30.0, 30.0)),\n    })\n    .insert(RenderLayers::layer(1));\n// spawn a camera that only draws the sprite on layer 1\ncommands\n    .spawn_bundle(OrthographicCameraBundle::new_2d());\n    .insert(RenderLayers::layer(1));\n\nSprite Flipping\n#\n\nauthors: @zicklag\nSprites can now be easily (and efficiently) flipped along the x or y axis:\n\ncommands.spawn_bundle(SpriteBundle {\n    material: material.clone(),\n    transform: Transform::from_xyz(150.0, 0.0, 0.0),\n    ..Default::default()\n});\ncommands.spawn_bundle(SpriteBundle {\n    material,\n    transform: Transform::from_xyz(-150.0, 0.0, 0.0),\n    sprite: Sprite {\n        // Flip the logo to the left\n        flip_x: true,\n        // And don't flip it upside-down ( the default )\n        flip_y: false,\n        ..Default::default()\n    },\n    ..Default::default()\n});\n\nColor Spaces\n#\n\nauthors: @mockersf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColor\n\n is now internally represented as an enum, which enables lossless (and correct) color representation. This is a significant improvement over the previous implementation, which internally converted all colors to linear sRGB (which could cause precision issues). Colors are now only converted to linear sRGB when they are sent to the GPU. We also took this opportunity to fix some incorrect color constants defined in the wrong color space.\npub enum Color {\n    /// sRGBA color\n    Rgba {\n        /// Red component. [0.0, 1.0]\n        red: f32,\n        /// Green component. [0.0, 1.0]\n        green: f32,\n        /// Blue component. [0.0, 1.0]\n        blue: f32,\n        /// Alpha component. [0.0, 1.0]\n        alpha: f32,\n    },\n    /// RGBA color in the Linear sRGB colorspace (often colloquially referred to as \"linear\", \"RGB\", or \"linear RGB\").\n    RgbaLinear {\n        /// Red component. [0.0, 1.0]\n        red: f32,\n        /// Green component. [0.0, 1.0]\n        green: f32,\n        /// Blue component. [0.0, 1.0]\n        blue: f32,\n        /// Alpha component. [0.0, 1.0]\n        alpha: f32,\n    },\n    /// HSL (hue, saturation, lightness) color with an alpha channel\n    Hsla {\n        /// Hue component. [0.0, 360.0]\n        hue: f32,\n        /// Saturation component. [0.0, 1.0]\n        saturation: f32,\n        /// Lightness component. [0.0, 1.0]\n        lightness: f32,\n        /// Alpha component. [0.0, 1.0]\n        alpha: f32,\n    },\n}\n\nWireframes\n#\n\nauthors: @Neo-Zhixing\nBevy can now draw wireframes using the opt-in WireframePlugin\n\nThese can either be enabled globally or per-entity by adding the new Wireframe component.\nSimple 3D Game Example: Alien Cake Addict\n#\n\nauthors: @mockersf\nThis example serves as a quick introduction to building 3D games in Bevy. It shows how to spawn scenes, respond to input, implement game logic, and handle state transitions. Pick up as many cakes as you can!\n\nTimer Improvements\n#\n\nauthors: @kokounet\nThe \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimer\n\n struct now internally uses \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDurations\n\n instead of using f32 representations of seconds. This both increases precision and makes the api a bit nicer to look at.\nfn system(mut timer: ResMut&lt;Timer&gt;, time: Res&lt;Time&gt;) {\n    if timer.tick(time.delta()).just_finished() {\n        println!(\"timer just finished\");\n    }\n}\n\nAssets Improvements\n#\n\nauthors: @willcrichton, @zicklag, @mockersf, @Archina\nBevy's asset system had a few minor improvements this release:\n\nBevy no longer panics on errors when loading assets\nAsset paths with multiple dots are now properly handled\nImproved type safety for \"labeled assets\" produced by asset loaders\nMade asset path loading case-insensitive\n\nWGPU Configuration Options\n#\n\nauthors: @Neo-Zhixing\nIt is now possible to enable/disable wgpu features (such as WgpuFeature::PushConstants and WgpuFeature::NonFillPolygonMode) by setting them in the WgpuOptions resource:\napp\n    .insert_resource(WgpuOptions {\n        features: WgpuFeatures {\n            features: vec![WgpuFeature::NonFillPolygonMode],\n        },\n        ..Default::default()\n    })\n\n\nWgpu limits (such as WgpuLimits::max_bind_groups) can also now be configured in the WgpuOptions resource.\nScene Instance Entity Iteration\n#\n\nauthors: @mockersf\nIt is now possible to iterate all entities in a spawned scene instance. This makes it possible to perform post-processing on scenes after they have been loaded.\nstruct MySceneInstance(InstanceId);\n\nfn setup(\n    mut commands: Commands,\n    asset_server: Res&lt;AssetServer&gt;,\n    mut scene_spawner: ResMut&lt;SceneSpawner&gt;,\n) {\n    // Spawn a scene and keep its `instance_id`\n    let instance_id = scene_spawner.spawn(asset_server.load(\"model.gltf#Scene0\"));\n    commands.insert_resource(MySceneInstance(instance_id));\n}\n\nfn print_scene_entities(\n    scene_spawner: Res&lt;SceneSpawner&gt;,\n    scene_instance: Res&lt;MySceneInstance&gt;,\n) {\n    if let Some(entity_iter) = scene_spawner.iter_instance_entities(scene_instance.0) {\n        for entity in entity_iter {\n            println!(\"Found scene entity {:?}\", entity);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWindow Resize Constraints\n#\n\nauthors: @digital7-code\nWindows can now have \"resize constraints\". Windows cannot be resized past these constraints\napp\n    .insert_resource(WindowDescriptor {\n        resize_constraints: WindowResizeConstraints {\n            min_height: 200.0,\n            max_height: 800.0,\n            ..Default::default()\n        },\n        ..Default::default()\n    })\n\n!Send Tasks\n#\n\nauthors: @alec-deason\nBevy's async task system now supports !Send tasks. Some tasks cannot be sent / run on other threads (such as tasks created by the upcoming Distill asset plugin). \"Thread local\" tasks can now be spawned in Bevy TaskPools like this:\nlet pool = TaskPool::default();\npool.scope(|scope| {\n    scope.spawn_local(async move {\n        println!(\"I am a local task\");\n    });\n});\n\nMore ECS V2 Changes\n#\n\nEntityRef / EntityMut\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\nWorld entity operations in Bevy 0.4 require that the user passes in an entity id to each operation:\nlet entity = world.spawn((A, )); // create a new entity with A\nworld.get::&lt;A&gt;(entity);\nworld.insert(entity, (B, C));\nworld.insert_one(entity, D);\n\nThis means that each operation needs to look up the entity location / verify its validity. The initial spawn operation also requires a Bundle as input. This can be awkward when no components are required (or one component is required).\nThese operations have been replaced by EntityRef and EntityMut, which are \"builder-style\" wrappers around world that provide read and read/write operations on a single, pre-validated entity:\n// spawn now takes no inputs and returns an EntityMut\nlet entity = world.spawn()\n    .insert(A) // insert a single component into the entity\n    .insert_bundle((B, C)) // insert a bundle of components into the entity\n    .id() // id returns the Entity id\n\n// Returns EntityMut (or panics if the entity does not exist)\nworld.entity_mut(entity)\n    .insert(D)\n    .insert_bundle(SomeBundle::default());\n\n// The `get_X` variants return Options, in case you want to check existence instead of panicking \nworld.get_entity_mut(entity)\n    .unwrap()\n    .insert(E);\n\nif let Some(entity_ref) = world.get_entity(entity) {\n    let d = entity_ref.get::&lt;D&gt;().unwrap();\n}\n\nCommands have also been updated to use this new pattern\nlet entity = commands.spawn()\n    .insert(A)\n    .insert_bundle((B, C))\n    .insert_bundle(SomeBundle::default())\n    .id();\n\nCommands also still support spawning with a Bundle, which should make migration from Bevy 0.4 easier. It also cuts down on boilerplate in some situations:\ncommands.spawn_bundle(SomeBundle::default());\n\nNote that these Command methods use the \"type state\" pattern, which means this style of chaining is no longer possible:\n// Spawns two entities, each with the components in SomeBundle and the A component\n// Valid in Bevy 0.4, but invalid in Bevy 0.5\ncommands\n    .spawn(SomeBundle::default())\n    .insert(A)\n    .spawn(SomeBundle::default())\n    .insert(A);\n\nInstead, you should do this:\ncommands\n    .spawn_bundle(SomeBundle::default())\n    .insert(A);\ncommands\n    .spawn_bundle(SomeBundle::default())\n    .insert(A);\n\nThis allows us to make things like \"entity id retrieval\" infallible and opens the doors to future api improvements.\nQuery::single\n#\n\nauthors: @TheRawMeatball\nQueries now have \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuery::single()\n\n and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuery::single_mut()\n\n methods, which return a single query result if there is exactly one matching entity:\nfn system(query: Query&lt;&amp;Player&gt;) {\n    // only returns Ok if there is exactly one Player\n    if let Ok(player) = query.single() {\n    }\n}\n\nRemoved ChangedRes\n#\n\nauthors: @TheRawMeatball\nWe have removed ChangedRes&lt;A&gt; in favor of the following:\nfn system(a: Res&lt;A&gt;) {\n    if a.is_changed() {\n        // do something\n    }\n}\n\nOptional Resource Queries\n#\n\nauthors: @jamadazi\nIt is now possible for a system to check for Resource existence via Option queries:\nfn system(a: Option&lt;Res&lt;A&gt;&gt;) {\n    if let Some(a) = a {\n        // do something\n    }\n}\n\nNew Bundle Naming Convention\n#\n\nComponent Bundles previously used the XComponents naming convention (ex: SpriteComponents, TextComponents, etc). We decided to move to a XBundle naming convention (ex: SpriteBundle, TextBundle, etc) to be more explicit about what these types are and to help prevent new users from conflating Bundles and Components.\nWorld Metadata Improvements\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\nWorld now has queryable Components, Archetypes, Bundles, and Entities collections:\n// you can access these new collections from normal systems, just like any other SystemParam\nfn system(archetypes: &amp;Archetypes, components: &amp;Components, bundles: &amp;Bundles, entities: &amp;Entities) {\n}\n\nThis enables developers to access internal ECS metadata from their Systems.\nConfigurable SystemParams\n#\n\nauthors: @cart, @DJMcNab\nUsers can now provide some initial configuration / values for system parameters (when possible). Most SystemParams have no config (the config type is ()), but the Local&lt;T&gt; param now supports user-provided parameters:\nfn foo(value: Local&lt;usize&gt;) {    \n}\n\napp.add_system(foo.system().config(|c| c.0 = Some(10)));\n\nPreparation for Scripting Support\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\nBevy ECS Components are now decoupled from Rust types. The new Components collection stores metadata such as memory layout and destructors. Components also no longer require Rust TypeIds.\nNew component metadata can be added at any time using world.register_component().\nAll component storage types (currently Table and Sparse Set) are \"blob storage\". They can store any value with a given memory layout. This enables data from other sources (ex: a Python data type) to be stored and accessed in the same way as Rust data types.\nWe haven't completely enabled scripting yet (and will likely never officially support non-Rust scripting), but this is a major step toward enabling community-supported scripting languages.\nMerged Resources into World\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\nResources are now just a special kind of Component. This allows us to keep the code size small by reusing existing Bevy ECS internals. It also enabled us to optimize the parallel executor access controls and it should make scripting language integration easier down the line.\nworld.insert_resource(1);\nworld.insert_resource(2.0);\nlet a = world.get_resource::&lt;i32&gt;().unwrap();\nlet mut b = world.get_resource_mut::&lt;f64&gt;().unwrap();\n*b = 3.0;\n\n// Resources are still accessed the same way in Systems\nfn system(foo: Res&lt;f64&gt;, bar: ResMut&lt;i32&gt;) {\n}\n\nBut this merge did create problems for people directly interacting with World. What if you need mutable access to multiple resources at the same time? world.get_resource_mut() borrows World mutably, which prevents multiple mutable accesses! We solved this with WorldCell.\nWorldCell\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\nWorldCell applies the \"access control\" concept used by Systems to direct world access:\nlet world_cell = world.cell();\nlet a = world_cell.get_resource_mut::&lt;i32&gt;().unwrap();\nlet b = world_cell.get_resource_mut::&lt;f64&gt;().unwrap();\n\nThis adds cheap runtime checks to ensure that world accesses do not conflict with each other.\nWe made this a separate api to enable users to decide what tradeoffs they want. Direct World access has stricter lifetimes, but it is more efficient and does compile time access control. WorldCell has looser lifetimes, but incurs a small runtime penalty as a result.\nThe api is currently limited to resource access, but it will be extended to queries / entity component access in the future.\nResource Scopes\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\nWorldCell does not yet support component queries, and even when it does there will sometimes be legitimate reasons to want a mutable world ref and a mutable resource ref (ex: bevy_render and bevy_scene both need this). In these cases we could always drop down to the unsafe world.get_resource_unchecked_mut(), but that is not ideal!\nInstead developers can use a \"resource scope\"\nworld.resource_scope(|world: &amp;mut World, mut a: Mut&lt;A&gt;| {\n})\n\nThis temporarily removes the A resource from World, provides mutable pointers to both, and re-adds A to World when finished. Thanks to the move to ComponentIds/sparse sets, this is a cheap operation.\nIf multiple resources are required, scopes can be nested. We could also consider adding a \"resource tuple\" to the api if this pattern becomes common and the boilerplate gets nasty.\nQuery Conflicts Use ComponentId Instead of ArchetypeComponentId\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\nFor safety reasons, systems cannot contain queries that conflict with each other without wrapping them in a QuerySet. In Bevy 0.4, we used ArchetypeComponentIds to determine conflicts. This was nice because it could take into account filters:\n// these queries will never conflict due to their filters\nfn filter_system(a: Query&lt;&amp;mut A, With&lt;B&gt;&gt;, b: Query&lt;&amp;mut B, Without&lt;B&gt;&gt;) {\n}\n\nBut it also had a significant downside:\n// these queries will not conflict _until_ an entity with A, B, and C is spawned\nfn maybe_conflicts_system(a: Query&lt;(&amp;mut A, &amp;C)&gt;, b: Query&lt;(&amp;mut A, &amp;B)&gt;) {\n}\n\nThe system above will panic at runtime if an entity with A, B, and C is spawned. This makes it hard to trust that your game logic will run without crashing.\nIn Bevy 0.5, we switched to using ComponentId instead of ArchetypeComponentId. This is more constraining. maybe_conflicts_system will now always fail, but it will do it consistently at startup.\nNaively, it would also disallow filter_system, which would be a significant downgrade in usability. Bevy has a number of internal systems that rely on disjoint queries and we expect it to be a common pattern in userspace. To resolve this, we added a new internal FilteredAccess&lt;T&gt; type, which wraps Access&lt;T&gt; and adds with/without filters. If two FilteredAccess have with/without values that prove they are disjoint, they will no longer conflict.\nThis means filter_system is still perfectly valid in Bevy 0.5. We get most of the benefits of the old implementation, but with consistent and predictable rules enforced at app startup.\nWhat's Next For Bevy?\n#\n\nWe still have a long road ahead of us, but the Bevy developer community is growing at a rapid pace and we already have big plans for the future. Expect to see progress in the following areas soon:\n\n\"Pipelined\" rendering and other renderer optimizations\nBevy UI redesign\nAnimation: component animation and 3d skeletal animation\nECS: relationships/indexing, async systems, archetype invariants, \"stageless\" system schedules\n3D Lighting Features: shadows, more light types\nMore Bevy Scene features and usability improvements\n\nWe also plan on breaking ground on the Bevy Editor as soon as we converge on a final Bevy UI design.\nSupport Bevy\n#\n\nSponsorships help make full time work on Bevy sustainable.

You can check out Quick Start Guide to get started. Bevy is also free and open source forever! You can grab the full source code on GitHub. Check out Bevy Assets for a collection of community-developed plugins, games, and learning resources.\nTo update an existing Bevy App or Plugin to Bevy 0.6, check out our 0.5 to 0.6 Migration Guide.\nThere are a ton of improvements, bug fixes and quality of life tweaks in this release. Here are some of the highlights:\n\nA brand new modern renderer that is prettier, faster, and simpler to extend\nDirectional and point light shadows\nClustered forward rendering\nFrustum culling\nSignificantly faster sprite rendering with less boilerplate\nNative WebGL2 support. You can test this out by running the Bevy Examples in your browser!\nHigh level custom Materials\nMore powerful shaders: preprocessors, imports, WGSL support\nBevy ECS ergonomics and performance improvements. No more .system()!\n\nRead on for details!\nThe New Bevy Renderer\n#\n\nBevy 0.6 introduces a brand new modern renderer that is:\n\nFaster: More parallel, less computation per-entity, more efficient CPU-&gt;GPU dataflow, and (with soon-to-be-enabled) pipelined rendering\nPrettier: We're releasing the new renderer alongside a number of graphical improvements, such as directional and point light shadows, clustered forward rendering (so you can draw more lights in a scene), and spherical area lights. We also have a ton of new features in development (cascaded shadow maps, bloom, particles, shadow filters, and more!)\nSimpler: Fewer layers of abstraction, simpler data flow, improved low-level, mid-level, and high-level interfaces, direct wgpu access\nModular to its core: Standardized 2d and 3d core pipelines, extensible Render Phases and Views, composable entity/component-driven draw functions, shader imports, extensible and repeatable render pipelines via \"sub graphs\"\nIndustry Proven: We've taken inspiration from battle tested renderer architectures, such as Bungie's pipelined Destiny renderer. We also learned a lot from (and worked closely with) other renderer developers in the Rust space, namely @aclysma (rafx) and @cwfitzgerald (rend3). The New Bevy Renderer wouldn't be what it is without them, and I highly recommend checking out their projects!\n\nI promise I'll qualify all of those fluffy buzzwords below. I am confident that the New Bevy Renderer will be a rallying point for the Bevy graphics ecosystem and (hopefully) the Rust graphics ecosystem at large. We still have plenty of work to do, but I'm proud of what we have accomplished so far and I'm excited for the future!\n\nWhy build a new renderer?\n#\n\nBefore we cover what's new, it's worth discussing why we embarked on such a massive effort. The old Bevy Renderer got a number of things right:\n\nModular render logic (via the Render Graph)\nMultiple backends (both first and third party)\nHigh level data-driven API: this made it easy and ergonomic to write custom per-entity render logic\n\nHowever, it also had a number of significant shortcomings:\n\nComplex: The \"high-level ease of use\" came at the cost of significant implementation complexity, performance overhead, and invented jargon. Users were often overwhelmed when trying to operate at any level but \"high-level\". When managing \"render resources\", it was easy to do something \"wrong\" and hard to tell \"what went wrong\".\nOften slow: Features like \"sprite rendering\" were built on the costly high-level abstractions mentioned above. Performance was ... suboptimal when compared to other options in the ecosystem.\nUser-facing internals: It stored a lot of internal render state directly on each entity. This took up space, computing the state was expensive, and it gunked up user-facing APIs with a bunch of \"do not touch\" render Components. This state (or at least, the component metadata) needed to be written to / read from Scenes, which was also suboptimal and error prone.\nRepeating render logic was troublesome: Viewports, rendering to multiple textures / windows, and shadow maps were possible, but they required hard-coding, special casing, and boilerplate. This wasn't aligned with our goals for modularity and clarity.\n\nWhy now?\n#\n\nThe shortcomings above were acceptable in Bevy's early days, but were clearly holding us back as Bevy grew from a one person side project to the most popular Rust game engine on GitHub (and one of the most popular open source game engines ... period). A \"passable\" renderer no longer cuts it when we have hundreds of contributors, a paid full-time developer, thousands of individual users, and a growing number of companies paying people to work on Bevy apps and features. It was time for a change.\nFor a deeper view into our decision-making and development process (including the alternatives we considered) check out the New Renderer Tracking Issue.\nPipelined Rendering: Extract, Prepare, Queue, Render\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\nPipelined Rendering is a cornerstone of the new renderer. It accomplishes a number of goals:\n\nIncreased Parallelism: We can now start running the main app logic for the next frame, while rendering the current frame. Given that rendering is often a bottleneck, this can be a huge win when there is also a lot of app work to do.\nClearer Dataflow and Structure: Pipelining requires drawing hard lines between \"app logic\" and \"render logic\", with a fixed synchronization point (which we call the \"extract\" step). This makes it easier to reason about dataflow and ownership. Code can be organized along these lines, which improves clarity.\n\nFrom a high level, traditional \"non-pipelined rendering\" looks like this:\n\nPipelined rendering looks like this:\n\nMuch better!\nBevy apps are now split into the Main App, which is where app logic occurs, and the Render App, which has its own separate ECS World and Schedule. The Render App consists of the following ECS stages, which developers add ECS Systems to when they are composing new render features:\n\nExtract: This is the one synchronization point between the Main World and the Render World. Relevant Entities, Components, and Resources are read from the Main World and written to corresponding Entities, Components, and Resources in the Render World. The goal is to keep this step as quick as possible, as it is the one piece of logic that cannot run in parallel. It is a good rule of thumb to extract only the minimum amount of data needed for rendering, such as by only considering \"visible\" entities and only copying the relevant components.\nPrepare: Extracted data is then \"prepared\" by writing it to the GPU. This generally involves writing to GPU Buffers and Textures and creating Bind Groups.\nQueue: This \"queues\" render jobs that feed off of \"prepared\" data.\nRender: This runs the Render Graph, which produces actual render commands from the results stored in the Render World from the Extract, Prepare, and Queue steps.\n\nSo pipelined rendering actually looks more like this, with the next app update occurring after the extract step:\n\nAs a quick callout, pipelined rendering doesn't actually happen in parallel yet. I have a branch with parallel pipelining enabled, but running app logic in a separate thread currently breaks \"non send\" resources (because the main app is moved to a separate thread, breaking non send guarantees). There will be a fix for this soon, I just wanted to get the new renderer in peoples' hands as soon as possible! When we enable parallel pipelining, no user-facing code changes will be required.\nRender Graphs and Sub Graphs\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\n\nThe New Bevy Renderer has a Render Graph, much like the old Bevy renderer. Render Graphs are a way to logically model GPU command construction in a modular way. Graph Nodes pass GPU resources like Textures and Buffers (and sometimes Entities) to each other, forming a directed acyclic graph. When a Graph Node runs, it uses its graph inputs and the Render World to construct GPU command lists.\nThe biggest change to this API is that we now support Sub Graphs, which are basically \"namespaced\" Render Graphs that can be run from any Node in the graph with arbitrary inputs. This enables us to define things like a \"2d\" and \"3d\" sub graph, which users can insert custom logic into. This opens two doors simultaneously:\n\nThe ability to repeat render logic, but for different views (split screen, mirrors, rendering to a texture, shadow maps).\nThe ability for users to extend this repeated logic.\n\nEmbracing wgpu\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\nBevy has always used wgpu, a native GPU abstraction layer with support for most graphics backends: Vulkan, Metal, DX12, OpenGL, WebGL2, and WebGPU (and WIP DX11 support). But the old renderer hid it behind our own hardware abstraction layer. In practice, this was largely just a mirror of the wgpu API. It gave us the ability to build our own graphics backends without bothering the wgpu folks, but in practice it created a lot of pain (due to being an imperfect mirror), overhead (due to introducing a dynamic API and requiring global mutex locks over GPU resource collections), and complexity (bevy_render -&gt; wgpu -&gt; Vulkan). In return, we didn't get many practical benefits ... just slightly more autonomy.\nThe truth of the matter is that wgpu already occupies exactly the space we want it to:\n\nMultiple backends, with the goal to support as many platforms as possible\nA \"baseline\" feature set that works almost everywhere with a consistent API\nA \"limits\" and \"features\" system that enables opting-in to arbitrary (sometimes backend-specific features) and detecting when those features are available. This will be important when we start adding things like raytracing and VR support.\nA modern GPU API, but without the pain and complexity of raw Vulkan. Perfect for user-facing Bevy renderer extensions.\n\nHowever, initially there were a couple of reasons not to make it our \"public facing API\":\n\nComplexity: wgpu used to be built on top of gfx-hal (an older GPU abstraction layer also built and managed by the wgpu team). These multiple layers of abstraction in multiple repos made contributing to and reasoning about the internals difficult. Additionally, I have a rule for \"3rd party dependencies publicly exposed in Bevy APIs\": we must feel comfortable forking and maintaining them if we need to (ex: upstream stops being maintained, visions diverge, etc). I wasn't particularly comfortable with doing that with the old architecture.\nLicensing: wgpu used to be licensed under the \"copyleft\" MPL license, which created concerns about integration with proprietary graphics apis (such as consoles like the Switch).\nWebGL2 Support: wgpu used to not have a WebGL2 backend. Bevy's old renderer had a custom WebGL2 backend and we weren't willing to give up support for the Web as a platform.\n\nAlmost immediately after we voiced these concerns, @kvark kicked off a relicensing effort that switched wgpu to the Rust-standard dual MIT/Apache-2.0 license. They also removed gfx-hal in favor of a much simpler and flatter architecture. Soon after, @zicklag added a WebGL2 backend. Having resolved all of my remaining hangups, it was clear to me that @kvark's priorities were aligned with mine and that I could trust them to adjust to community feedback.\nThe New Bevy Renderer tosses out our old intermediate GPU abstraction layer in favor of using wgpu directly as our \"low-level\" GPU api. The result is a simpler (and faster) architecture with full and direct access to wgpu. Feedback from Bevy Renderer feature developers so far has been very positive.\nBevy was also updated to use the latest and greatest wgpu version: 0.12.\nECS-Driven Rendering\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\nThe new renderer is what I like to call \"ECS-driven\":\n\nAs we covered previously, the Render World is populated using data Extracted from the Main World.\nScenes are rendered from one or more Views, which are just Entities in the Render World with Components relevant to that View. View Entities can be extended with arbitrary Components, which makes it easy to extend the renderer with custom View data and logic. Cameras aren't the only type of View. Views can be defined by the Render App for arbitrary concepts, such as \"shadow map perspectives\".\nViews can have zero or more generic RenderPhase&lt;T: PhaseItem&gt; Components, where T defines the \"type and scope\" of thing being rendered in the phase (ex: \"transparent 3d entities in the main pass\"). At its core, a RenderPhase is a (potentially sorted) list of Entities to be drawn.\nEntities in a RenderPhase are drawn using DrawFunctions, which read ECS data from the Render World and produce GPU commands.\nDrawFunctions can (optionally) be composed of modular DrawCommands. These are generally scoped to specific actions like SetStandardMaterialBindGroup, DrawMesh, SetItemPipeline, etc. Bevy provides a number of built-in DrawCommands and users can also define their own.\nRender Graph Nodes convert a specific View's RenderPhases into GPU commands by iterating each RenderPhases' Entities and running the appropriate Draw Functions.\n\nIf that seems complicated ... don't worry! These are what I like to call \"mid-level\" renderer APIs. They provide the necessary tools for experienced render feature developers to build modular render plugins with relative ease. We also provide easy to use high-level APIs like Materials, which cover the majority of \"custom shader logic\" use cases.\nBevy's Core Pipeline\n#\n\nauthors: @cart, Rob Swain (@superdump), @KirmesBude, @mockersf\nThe new renderer is very flexible and unopinionated by default. However, too much flexibility isn't always desirable. We want a rich Bevy renderer plugin ecosystem where developers have enough freedom to implement what they want, while still maximizing compatibility across plugins.\nThe new bevy_core_pipeline crate is our answer to this problem. It defines a \"core\" set of Views / Cameras (2d and 3d), Sub Graphs (ClearPass, MainPass2d, MainPass3d), and Render Phases (Transparent2d, Opaque3d, AlphaMask3d, Transparent3d). This provides a \"common ground\" for render feature developers to build on while still maintaining compatibility with each other. As long as developers operate within these constraints, they should be compatible with the wider ecosystem. Developers are also free to operate outside these constraints, but that also increases the likelihood that they will be incompatible.\nBevy's built-in render features build on top of the Core Pipeline (ex: bevy_sprite and bevy_pbr). The Core Pipeline will continue to expand with things like a standardized \"post-processing\" effect stack.\nMaterials\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\nThe new renderer structure gives developers fine-grained control over how entities are drawn. Developers can manually define Extract, Prepare, and Queue systems to draw entities using arbitrary render commands in custom or built-in \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRenderPhases\n\n. However this level of control necessitates understanding the render pipeline internals and involve more boilerplate than most users are willing to tolerate. Sometimes all you want to do is slot your custom material shader into the existing pipelines!\nThe new \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterial\n\n trait enables users to ignore nitty gritty details in favor of a simpler interface: just implement the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterial\n\n trait and add a \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterialPlugin\n\n for your type. The new shader_material.rs example illustrates this.\n// register the plugin for a CustomMaterial\napp.add_plugin(MaterialPlugin::&lt;CustomMaterial&gt;::default())\n\nimpl Material for CustomMaterial {\n    // the vertex and fragment shaders are optional\n    // they use a default \"mesh pipeline shader\" if they are not defined\n    fn fragment_shader(asset_server: &amp;AssetServer) -&gt; Option&lt;Handle&lt;Shader&gt;&gt; {\n        Some(asset_server.load(\"shaders/custom_material.wgsl\"))\n    }\n\n    fn bind_group_layout(render_device: &amp;RenderDevice) -&gt; BindGroupLayout {\n        /* return bind group layout here */\n    }\n\n    fn bind_group(render_asset: &amp;&lt;Self as RenderAsset&gt;::PreparedAsset) -&gt; &amp;BindGroup {\n        /* return bind group here */\n    }\n}\n\nThere is also a \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecializedMaterial\n\n variant, which enables \"specializing\" shaders and pipelines using custom per-entity keys. This extra flexibility isn't always needed, but when you need it, you will be glad to have it! For example, the built-in StandardMaterial uses specialization to toggle whether or not the Entity should receive lighting in the shader.\nWe also have big plans to make \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials\n\n even better:\n\nBind Group derives: this should cut down on the boilerplate of passing materials to the GPU.\nMaterial Instancing: materials enable us to implement high-level mesh instancing as a simple configuration item for both built in and custom materials.\n\nVisibility and Frustum Culling\n#\n\nauthors: Rob Swain (@superdump)\n\nDrawing things is expensive! It requires writing data from the CPU to the GPU, constructing draw calls, and running shaders. We can save a lot of time by not drawing things that the camera can't see. \"Frustum culling\" is the act of excluding objects that are outside the bounds of the camera's \"view frustum\", to avoid wasting work drawing them. For large scenes, this can be the difference between a crisp 60 frames per second and chugging to a grinding halt.\nBevy 0.6 now automatically does frustum culling for 3d objects using their axis-aligned bounding boxes. We might also enable this for 2d objects in future releases, but the wins there will be less pronounced, as drawing sprites is now much cheaper thanks to the new batched rendering.\nDirectional Shadows\n#\n\nauthors: Rob Swain (@superdump)\nDirectional Lights can now cast \"directional shadows\", which are \"sun-like\" shadows cast from a light source infinitely far away. These can be enabled by setting DirectionalLight::shadows_enabled to true.\n\nNote: directional shadows currently require more manual configuration than necessary (check out the shadow_projection field in the DirectionalLight setup in the shadow_biases.rs example). We will soon make this automatic and better quality over a larger range through cascaded shadow maps.\nPoint Light Shadows\n#\n\nauthors: @mtsr, Rob Swain (@superdump), @cart\nPoint lights can now cast \"omnidirectional shadows\", which can be enabled by setting PointLight::shadows_enabled to true:\n\nEnabling and Disabling Entity Shadows\n#\n\nauthors: Rob Swain (@superdump)\nMesh entities can opt out of casting shadows by adding the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotShadowCaster\n\n component.\ncommands.entity(entity).insert(NotShadowCaster);\n\nLikewise, they can opt out of receiving shadows by adding the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotShadowReceiver\n\n component.\ncommands.entity(entity).insert(NotShadowReceiver);\n\nSpherical Area Lights\n#\n\nauthors: @Josh015\nPointLight Components can now define a radius value, which controls the size of the sphere that emits light. A normal zero-sized \"point light\" has a radius of zero.\n\n(Note that lights with a radius don't normally take up physical space in the world ... I added meshes to help illustrate light position and size)\nConfigurable Alpha Blend Modes\n#\n\nauthors: Rob Swain (@superdump)\nBevy's StandardMaterial now has an alpha_mode field, which can be set to AlphaMode::Opaque, AlphaMode::Mask(f32), or AlphaMode::Blend. This field is properly set when loading GLTF scenes.\n\nClustered Forward Rendering\n#\n\nauthors: Rob Swain (@superdump)\nModern scenes often have many point lights. But when rendering scenes, calculating lighting for each light, for each rendered fragment rapidly becomes prohibitively expensive as the number of lights in the scene increases. Clustered Forward Rendering is a popular approach that increases the number of lights you can have in a scene by dividing up the view frustum into \"clusters\" (a 3d grid of sub-volumes). Each cluster is assigned lights based on whether they can affect that cluster. This is a form of \"culling\" that enables fragments to ignore lights that aren't assigned to their cluster.\nIn practice this can significantly increase the number of lights in the scene:\n\nClusters are 3d subdivisions of the view frustum. They are cuboids in projected space so for a perspective projection, they are stretched and skewed in view space. When debugging them in screen space, you are looking along a row of clusters and so they look like squares. Different colors within a square represent mesh surfaces being at different depths in the scene and so they belong to different clusters:\n\nThe current implementation is limited to at most 256 lights as we initially prioritized cross-platform compatibility so that everyone could benefit. WebGL2 specifically does not support storage buffers and so the implementation is currently constrained by the maximum uniform buffer size. We can support many more lights on other platforms by using storage buffers, which we will add support for in a future release.\nClick here for a video that illustrates Bevy's clustered forward rendering.\nSprite Batching\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\nSprites are now rendered in batches according to their texture within a z-level. They are also opportunistically batched across z-levels. This yields significant performance wins because it drastically reduces the number of draw calls required. Combine that with the other performance improvements in the new Bevy Renderer and things start to get very interesting! On my machine, the old Bevy renderer generally started dropping below 60fps at around 8,000 sprites in our \"bevymark\" benchmark. With the new renderer on that same machine I can get about 100,000 sprites!\n\nMy machine: Nvidia GTX 1070, Intel i7 7700k, 16GB ram, Arch Linux\nSprite Ergonomics\n#\n\nSprite entities are now simpler to spawn:\nfn spawn_sprite(mut commands: Commands, asset_server: Res&lt;AssetServer&gt;) {\n    commands.spawn_bundle(SpriteBundle {\n        texture: asset_server.load(\"player.png\"),\n        ..Default::default()\n    });\n}\n\nNo need to manage sprite materials! Their texture handle is now a direct component and color can now be set directly on the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSprite\n\n component.\n\n    To compare, expand this to see the old Bevy 0.5 code\n// Old (Bevy 0.5)\nfn spawn_sprite(\n    mut commands: Commands,\n    asset_server: Res&lt;AssetServer&gt;,\n    mut materials: ResMut&lt;Assets&lt;ColorMaterial&gt;&gt;,\n) {\n    let texture_handle = asset_server.load(\"player.png\");\n    commands.spawn_bundle(SpriteBundle {\n        material: materials.add(texture_handle.into()),\n        ..Default::default()\n    });\n}\n\n\nWGSL Shaders\n#\n\nBevy now uses WGSL for our built-in shaders and examples. WGSL is a new shader language being developed for WebGPU (although it is a \"cross platform\" shader language just like GLSL). Bevy still supports GLSL shaders, but WGSL is nice enough that, for now, we are treating it as our \"officially recommended\" shader language. WGSL is still being developed and polished, but given how much investment it is receiving I believe it is worth betting on. Consider this the start of the \"official Bevy shader language\" conversation, not the end of it.\n[[group(0), binding(0)]]\nvar&lt;uniform&gt; view: View;\n\n[[group(1), binding(0)]]\nvar&lt;uniform&gt; mesh: Mesh;\n\nstruct Vertex {\n    [[location(0)]] position: vec3&lt;f32&gt;;\n};\n\nstruct VertexOutput {\n    [[builtin(position)]] clip_position: vec4&lt;f32&gt;;\n};\n\n[[stage(vertex)]]\nfn vertex(vertex: Vertex) -&gt; VertexOutput {\n    var out: VertexOutput;\n    out.clip_position = view.view_proj * mesh.model * vec4&lt;f32&gt;(vertex.position, 1.0);\n    return out;\n}\n\nShader Preprocessor\n#\n\nauthors: @cart, Rob Swain (@superdump), @mockersf\nBevy now has its own custom shader preprocessor. It currently supports #import, #ifdef FOO, #ifndef FOO, #else, and #endif, but we will be expanding it with more features to enable simple, flexible shader code reuse and extension.\nShader preprocessors are often used to conditionally enable shader code:\n#ifdef TEXTURE\n[[group(1), binding(0)]]\nvar sprite_texture: texture_2d&lt;f32&gt;;\n#endif\n\nThis pattern is very useful when defining complicated / configurable shaders (such as Bevy's PBR shader).\nShader Imports\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\nThe new preprocessor supports importing other shader files (which pulls in their entire contents). This comes in two forms:\nAsset path imports:\n#import \"shaders/cool_function.wgsl\"\n\n[[stage(fragment)]]\nfn fragment(input: VertexOutput) -&gt; [[location(0)]] vec4&lt;f32&gt; {\n    return cool_function();\n}\n\nPlugin-provided imports, which can be registered by Bevy Plugins with arbitrary paths:\n#import bevy_pbr::mesh_view_bind_group\n\n[[stage(vertex)]]\nfn vertex(vertex: Vertex) -&gt; VertexOutput {\n    let world_position = vec4&lt;f32&gt;(vertex.position, 1.0);\n    var out: VertexOutput;\n    // The `view` variable comes from the imported bind group \n    out.clip_position = view.view_proj * world_position;\n    return out;\n}\n\nWe also plan to experiment with using Naga for \"partial imports\" of specific, named symbols (ex: import a specific function or struct from a file). It's a 'far out' idea, but this could also enable using Naga's intermediate shader representation as a way of combining pieces of shader code written in different languages into one shader.\nPipeline Specialization\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\nWhen shaders use a preprocessor and have multiple permutations, the associated \"render pipeline\" needs to be updated to accommodate those permutations (ex: different Vertex Attributes, Bind Groups, etc). To make this process straightforward, we added the SpecializedPipeline trait, which allows defining specializations for a given key:\nimpl SpecializedPipeline for MyPipeline {\n    type Key = MyPipelineKey;\n    // The key here is specified for entities when queuing them up in a RenderPhase\n    fn specialize(&amp;self, key: Self::Key) -&gt; RenderPipelineDescriptor {\n        // define a specialized pipeline for the given key here\n    }\n}\n\nImplementors of this trait can then easily and cheaply access specialized pipeline variants (with automatic per-key caching and hot-reloading). If this feels too abstract / advanced, don't worry! This is a \"mid-level power-user tool\", not something most Bevy App developers need to contend with.\nSimpler Shader Stack\n#\n\nBevy now uses Naga for all of its shader needs. As a result, we were able to remove all of our complicated non-rust shader dependencies: glsl_to_spirv, shaderc, and spirv_reflect. glsl_to_spirv was a major producer of platform-specific build dependencies and bugs, so this is a huge win!\nFeatures Ported to the New Renderer\n#\n\nRender logic for internal Bevy crates had to be rewritten in a number of cases to take advantage of the new renderer. The following people helped with this effort:\n\nbevy_sprites: @cart, @StarArawn, @Davier\nbevy_pbr: Rob Swain (@superdump), @aevyrie, @cart, @zicklag, @jakobhellermann\nbevy_ui: @Davier\nbevy_text: @Davier\nbevy_gltf: Rob Swain (@superdump)\n\nWebGL2 Support\n#\n\nauthors: @zicklag, @mrk-its, @mockersf, Rob Swain (@superdump)\nBevy now has built-in support for deploying to the web using WebGL2 / WASM, thanks to @zicklag adding a native WebGL2 backend to wgpu. There is now no need for the third party bevy_webgl2 plugin. Any Bevy app can be deployed to the web by running the following commands:\ncargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown\nwasm-bindgen --out-dir OUTPUT_DIR --target web TARGET_DIR\n\nThe New Bevy Renderer developers prioritized cross-platform compatibility for the initial renderer feature implementation and so had to carefully operate within the limits of WebGL2 (ex: storage buffers and compute shaders aren't supported in WebGL2), but the results were worth it! Over time, features will be implemented that leverage more modern/advanced features such as compute shaders. But it is important to us that everyone has access to a solid visual experience for their games and applications regardless of their target platform(s).\nYou can try out Bevy's WASM support in your browser using our new Bevy Examples page:\n\nInfinite Reverse Z Perspective Projection\n#\n\nauthors: Rob Swain (@superdump)\nFor improved precision in the \"useful range\", the industry has largely adopted \"reverse projections\" with an \"infinite\" far plane. The new Bevy renderer was adapted to use the \"right-handed infinite reverse z\" projection. This Nvidia article does a great job of explaining why this is so worthwhile.\nCompute Shaders\n#\n\nThe new renderer makes it possible for users to write compute shaders. Our new \"compute shader game of life\" example (by @jakobhellermann) illustrates how to write compute shaders in Bevy.\n\nNew Multiple Windows Example\n#\n\nauthors: @DJMcNab\nThe \"multiple windows\" example has been updated to use the new renderer APIs. Thanks to the new renderer APIs, this example is now much nicer to look at (and will look even nicer when we add high-level Render Targets).\n\nCrevice\n#\n\nauthors: @cart, @mockersf, Rob Swain (@superdump)\nBevy's old Bytes abstraction has been replaced with a fork of the crevice crate (by @LPGhatguy), which makes it possible to write normal Rust types to GPU-friendly data layouts. Namely std140 (uniform buffers default to this layout) and std430 (storage buffers default to this layout). Bevy exports AsStd140 and AsStd430 derives:\n#[derive(AsStd140)]\npub struct MeshUniform {\n    pub transform: Mat4,\n    pub inverse_transpose_model: Mat4,\n}\n\nCoupling an AsStd140 derive with our new UniformVec&lt;T&gt; type makes it easy to write Rust types to shader-ready uniform buffers:\n// WGSL shader\nstruct Mesh {\n    model: mat4x4&lt;f32&gt;;\n    inverse_transpose_model: mat4x4&lt;f32&gt;;\n};\n\n[[group(2), binding(0)]]\nvar&lt;uniform&gt; mesh: Mesh;\n\nWe (in the short term) forked crevice for a couple of reasons:\n\nTo merge Array Support PR by @ElectronicRU, as we need support for arrays in our uniforms.\nTo re-export crevice derives and provide an \"out of the box\" experience for Bevy\n\nUltimately, we'd like to move back upstream if possible. A big thanks to the crevice developers for building such useful software!\nUV Sphere Mesh Shape\n#\n\nauthors: @nside\nBevy now has a built-in \"uv sphere\" mesh primitive.\nMesh::from(UVSphere {\n    radius: 1.0,\n    sectors: 16,\n    stacks: 32,\n})\n\n\nFlat Normal Computation\n#\n\nauthors: @jakobhellermann\nThe Mesh type now has a compute_flat_normals() function. Imported GLTF meshes without normals now automatically have flat normals computed, in accordance with the GLTF spec.\n\nFaster GLTF Loading\n#\n\nauthors: @DJMcNab, @mockersf\n@DJMcNab fixed nasty non-linear loading of GLTF nodes, which made them load much faster. One complicated scene went from 40 seconds to 0.2 seconds. Awesome!\n@mockersf made GLTF textures load asynchronously in Bevy's \"IO task pool\", which almost halved GLTF scene load times in some cases.\nWe are also in the process of adding \"compressed texture loading\", which will substantially speed up GLTF scene loading, especially for large scenes!\nBevy ECS\n#\n\nNo more .system()!\n#\n\nauthors: @DJMcNab, @Ratysz\nOne of our highest priorities for Bevy ECS is \"ergonomics\". In the past I have made wild claims that Bevy ECS is the most ergonomic ECS in existence. We've spent gratuitous amounts of R&amp;D pioneering new API techniques and I believe the results speak for themselves:\n// This is a standalone Bevy 0.5 App that adds a simple `gravity` system to the App's schedule\n// and automatically runs it in parallel with other systems\nfn main() {\n    App::build()\n        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n        .add_system(gravity.system())\n        .run();\n}\n\nfn gravity(time: Res&lt;Time&gt;, mut query: Query&lt;&amp;mut Transform&gt;) {\n    for mut transform in query.iter_mut() {\n        transform.translation.y += -9.8 * time.delta_seconds();\n    }\n}\n\nI believe we were already the best in the market by a wide margin (especially if you take into account our automatic parallelization and change detection), but we had one thing holding us back from perfection ... that pesky .system()! We've tried removing it a number of times, but due to rustc limitations and safety issues, it always eluded us. Finally, @DJMcNab found a solution. As a result, in Bevy 0.6 you can now register the system above like this:\n// pure bliss!\nApp::new()\n    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n    .add_system(gravity)\n    .run();\n\nThe New Component Trait and #[derive(Component)]\n#\n\nauthors: @Frizi\nIn Bevy 0.6 types no longer implement the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\n\n trait by default. Before you get angry ... stick with me for a second. I promise this is for the best! In past Bevy versions, we got away with \"auto implementing\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\n\n for types using this \"blanket impl\":\nimpl&lt;T: Send + Sync + 'static&gt; Component for T {}\n\nThis removed the need for users to manually implement \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\n\n for their types. Early on this seemed like an ergonomics win with no downsides. But Bevy ECS, our understanding of the problem space, and our plans for the future have changed a lot since then:\n\nIt turns out not everything should be a Component: Our users constantly accidentally add non-component types as components. New users accidentally adding Bundles and type constructors as Components are our most common #help channel threads on our Discord. This class of error is very hard to debug because things just silently \"don't work\". When not everything is a Component, rustc can properly yell at you with informative errors when you mess up.\nOptimizations: If we implement Component for everything automatically, we can't customize the Component type with associated types. This prevents an entire class of optimization. For example, Bevy ECS now has multiple Component storage types. By moving the storage type into Component, we enable rustc to optimize checks that would normally need to happen at runtime. @Frizi was able to significantly improve our Query iterator performance by moving the storage type into Component. I expect us to find more optimizations in this category.\nAutomatic registration: Moving more logic into Component also gives us the ability to do fancier things in the future like \"automatically registering Reflect impls when deriving Component\". Non-blanket Component impls do add a small amount of boilerplate, but they also have the potential to massively reduce the \"total boilerplate\" of an app.\nDocumentation: Deriving Component serves as a form of self-documentation. It's now easy to tell what types are components at a glance.\nOrganized: In Bevy 0.5 Component-specific configuration like \"storage type\" had to be registered in a centralized Plugin somewhere. Moving Component configuration into the Component trait allows users to keep \"Component type information\" right next to the type itself.\nEvent Handlers: Non-blanket Component impls will eventually allow us to add event handlers like on_insert(world: &amp;mut World) to the Component trait. Very useful!\n\nHopefully by now you're convinced that this is the right move. If not ... I'm sorry ... you still need to implement Component manually in Bevy 0.6. You can either derive Component:\n// defaults to \"Table\" storage\n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct SomeComponent;\n\n// overrides the default storage\n#[derive(Component)]\n#[component(storage = \"SparseSet\")]\nstruct SomeComponent;\n\nOr you can manually implement it:\nstruct SomeComponent;\n\nimpl Component for SomeComponent {\n    type Storage = TableStorage;\n}\n\nimpl Component for SomeComponent {\n    type Storage = SparseSetStorage;\n}\n\niter() for mutable Queries\n#\n\nauthors: @Guvante\nMutable queries can now be immutably iterated, returning immutable references to components:\nfn system(mut players: Query&lt;&amp;mut Player&gt;) {\n    for player in players.iter() {\n        // player is an immutable reference\n    }\n\n    for mut player in players.iter_mut() {\n        // player is a mutable reference\n    }\n}\n\nCompare that to the complicated QuerySet that this would have needed in previous Bevy versions to avoid conflicting immutable and mutable Queries:\n// Gross!\nfn system(mut players: QuerySet&lt;(QueryState&lt;&amp;Player&gt;, QueryState&lt;&amp;mut Player&gt;)&gt;) {\n    for player in players.q0().iter() {\n        // player is an immutable reference\n    }\n\n    for mut player in players.q1().iter_mut() {\n        // player is a mutable reference\n    }\n}\n\nSystemState\n#\n\nHave you ever wanted to use \"system params\" directly with a Bevy World? With \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystemState\n\n, now you can!\nlet mut system_state: SystemState&lt;(Res&lt;A&gt;, Query&lt;&amp;B&gt;)&gt; = SystemState::new(&amp;mut world);\nlet (a, query) = system_state.get(&amp;world);\n\nFor those working directly with World, this is a game changer. It makes it possible to mutably access multiple disjoint Components and Resources (often eliminating the need for more costly abstractions like WorldCell).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystemState\n\n does all of the same caching that a normal Bevy system does, so reusing the same SystemState results in uber-fast World access.\nSub Apps\n#\n\nauthors: @cart, @zicklag, @bjorn3\nThe new Bevy renderer requires strict separation between the \"main app\" and the \"render app\". To enable this, we added the concept of \"sub-apps\":\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, Hash, PartialEq, Eq, AppLabel)]\npub struct RenderApp;\n\nlet mut render_app = App::empty();\napp.add_sub_app(RenderApp, render_app, move |app_world, render_app| {\n    // execute app logic here\n});\n\n// later\napp.sub_app_mut(RenderApp)\n    .add_system(some_system);\n    .add_system(some_other_system);\n\nWe plan on exposing more control over scheduling, running, and working with sub-apps in the future.\nQuery::iter_combinations\n#\n\nauthors: @Frizi\nYou can now iterate all combinations of N entities for a given query:\nfn system(query: Query&lt;&amp;Player&gt;) {\n    // iterates each possible combination of two entities exactly once\n    for [p1, p2] in query.iter_combinations() {\n    }\n\n    // iterates each possible combination of three entities exactly once\n    for [p1, p2, p3] in query.iter_combinations() {\n    }\n}\n\nThis is especially useful for things like \"checking for entities for collisions with all other entities\". There is also an iter_combinations_mut variant. Just be careful ... the time complexity of this grows exponentially as the number of entities in your combinations increases. With great power comes great responsibility!\nThe new iter_combinations example illustrates how to use this new API to calculate gravity between objects in a \"solar system\":\n\nOptimized System Commands\n#\n\nauthors: @NathanSWard\nSystem Commands got a nice performance boost by changing how command buffers are stored and reused:\nEntity Spawn Benchmark Duration (in microseconds, less is better)\n#\n\nThis benchmark spawns entities with a variety of component compositions to ensure we cover a variety of cases. Treat these numbers as relatives, not absolutes.\n\nSystem Param Lifetimes\n#\n\nauthors: @cart, @BoxyUwU, @TheRawMeatball\nSystem and Query lifetimes were made more explicit by splitting out the 'system and 'world, lifetimes and using them explicitly where possible. This enables Rust to reason about ECS lifetimes more effectively, especially for read-only lifetimes. This was particularly important because it enabled the new Bevy Renderer to convince wgpu that ECS resources actually live for as long as the Render World.\nNote that this does make the lifetimes on SystemParam derives slightly more complicated as a result:\n#[derive(SystemParam)]\nstruct CustomParam&lt;'w, 's&gt; {\n    res: Res&lt;'w, AssetServer&gt;,\n    query: Query&lt;'w, 's, Read&lt;Transform&gt;&gt;,\n    local: Local&lt;'s, i32&gt;,\n}\n\nSoundness / Correctness Improvements\n#\n\nauthors: @BoxyUwU, @TheRawMeatball, @Frizi, @thebluefish, @sapir, @bjorn3, @DJMcNab\nBevy ECS received a solid number of soundness and correctness bug fixes this release, alongside some unsafe code block removals. Queries and internal storages like Tables and BlobVecs in particular had a number of fixes and improvements in these areas. As Bevy ECS matures, our bar for unsafe code blocks and soundness must also mature. Bevy ECS will probably never be 100% free of unsafe code blocks, because we are modeling parallel data access that Rust literally cannot reason about without our help. But we are committed to removing as much unsafe code as we can (and we have a number of refactors in the works to further improve the situation).\nHierarchy Convenience Functions\n#\n\nauthors: @TheRawMeatball, @jihiggins\n// Despawns all descendants of an entity (its children, its childrens' children, etc)\ncommands.entity(e).despawn_descendants();\n\n// Removes the given children from the entity\ncommands.entity(parent).remove_children(&amp;[child1, child2]);\n\nUI\n#\n\nOverflow::Hidden\n#\n\nauthors: @Davier\nUI now respects the flexbox Overflow::Hidden property. This can be used to cut off child content, which is useful when building things like scrollable lists:\n\nText2D Transforms\n#\n\nauthors: @nside, @CleanCut\nText2d now supports arbitrary transformations using the Transform component:\n\nNote that while Transform::scale does have its uses, it is generally still a good idea to adjust text size using the \"font size\" to ensure it renders \"crisply\".\nWindow Transparency\n#\n\nauthors: @louisgjohnson\nWinit's \"window transparency\" feature is now exposed in Bevy's Window type. This allows users to build \"widget like\" apps without backgrounds or window decorations (on platforms that support it). Here is a Bevy app with a transparent background, rendering a Bevy Logo sprite on top of my Linux desktop background. Seamless! Cool!\n\nTransforms\n#\n\nFriendly Directional Vectors\n#\n\nauthors: @guimcaballero\nBevy Transforms now have friendly \"directional\" functions that return relative vectors:\n// Points to the left of the transform\nlet left: Vec4 = transform.left();\n// Points to the right of the transform\nlet right: Vec4 = transform.right();\n// Points up from the transform\nlet up: Vec4 = transform.up();\n// Points down from the transform\nlet down: Vec4 = transform.down();\n// Points forward from the transform\nlet forward: Vec4 = transform.forward();\n// Points back from the transform\nlet back: Vec4 = transform.back();\n\nTransform Builder Methods\n#\n\nauthors: @Lythenas\nTransforms now have helpful with_translation(), with_rotation(), and with_scale() builder methods:\nTransform::from_xyz(0.0, 0.0, 10.0).with_scale(Vec3::splat(2.0))\n\nRust 2021\n#\n\nauthors: @mockersf, @YohDeadfall\nBevy has been updated to use Rust 2021. This means we can take advantage of the new Cargo feature resolver by default (which both Bevy and the new wgpu version require). Make sure you update your crates to Rust 2021 or you will need to manually enable the new feature resolver with resolver = \"2\" in your Cargo.toml.\n[package]\nname = \"your_app\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nedition = \"2021\"\n\nNote that \"virtual Cargo workspaces\" still need to manually define resolver = \"2\", even in Rust 2021. Refer to the Rust 2021 documentation for details.\n[workspace]\nresolver = \"2\" # Important! wgpu/Bevy needs this!\nmembers = [ \"my_crate1\", \"my_crate2\" ]\n\nInput\n#\n\nGamepads Resource\n#\n\nauthors: @CrazyRoka\nBevy 0.6 adds a Gamepads resource, which automatically maintains a collection of connected gamepads.\nfn system(gamepads: Res&lt;Gamepads&gt;) {\n    // iterates every active game pad\n    for gamepad in gamepads.iter() {\n    }\n}\n\nInput \"any\" variants\n#\n\nauthors: @DJMcNab\nInput collections now have an any_pressed() function, which returns true when any of the given inputs are pressed.\n fn system(input: Res&lt;Input&lt;KeyCode&gt;&gt;) {\n    if input.any_pressed([KeyCode::LShift, KeyCode::RShift]) {\n        println!(\"one or both of the two shift keys are pressed\");\n    }\n }\n\nProfiling\n#\n\nMore Spans\n#\n\nauthors: @cart, @mockersf, @hymm\nThe new renderer now has tracing spans for frames, the render app schedule, and the Render Graph (with named Sub Graphs spans). The system executor now has finer grained spans, filling in most of the remaining blanks. Applying System Commands also now has spans.\n(ignore those weird characters in the spans ... we're investigating that)\n\nTracy Backend\n#\n\nauthors: Rob Swain (@superdump)\nBevy now supports the tracy profiler via the trace_tracy Cargo feature.\n\nFromReflect Trait and Derive\n#\n\nauthors: @Davier\nTypes can now derive the new FromReflect trait, which enables creating \"clones\" of a type using arbitrary Reflect impls. This is currently used to make reflected collection types (like Vec) work properly, but it will also be useful for \"round trip\" conversions to and from Reflect types.\n#[derive(Reflect, FromReflect)]\nstruct Foo {\n    bar: usize,\n}\n\nlet foo = Foo::from_reflect(&amp;dyn some_reflected_value).unwrap(); \n\nBevy Error Codes\n#\n\nauthors: @mockersf, @NiklasEi\nTo make it easier to search for and discuss common Bevy errors, we decided to add a formal error codes system, much like the one that rustc uses;\nError codes and their descriptions also have an automatically-generated page on the Bevy website.\nBevy Assets\n#\n\nauthors: @mockersf\nThe curated awesome-bevy GitHub repo containing a list of Bevy plugins, crates, apps, and learning resources is now reborn as Bevy Assets!\nBevy Assets introduces:\n\nA structured toml format\nAsset icons\nbevy-website integration\n\nThis is just the beginning! We have plans to integrate with crates.io and GitHub, improve indexing / tagging / searchability, add asset-specific pages, prettier styles, content delivery, and more. Ultimately we want this to grow into something that can enable first-class, modern asset-driven workflows.\nWe have automatically migrated existing awesome-bevy entries, but we encourage creators to customize them! If you are working on something Bevy related, you are highly encouraged to add a Bevy Assets entry.\nDual MIT / Apache-2.0 License\n#\n\nauthors: @cart, @DJMcNab\nThanks to the relevant contributors (all 246 of them), Bevy is now dual licensed under MIT and Apache-2.0, at the developers' option. This means developers have the flexibility to choose the license that best suits their specific needs. I want to stress that this is now less restrictive than MIT-only, not more.\nI originally chose to license Bevy exclusively under MIT for a variety of reasons:\n\nPeople and companies generally know and trust the MIT license more than any other license. Apache 2.0 is less known and trusted.\nIt is short and easy to understand\nMany people aren't familiar with the \"multiple license options ... choose your favorite\" approach. I didn't want to scare people away unnecessarily.\nOther open source engines like Godot have had a lot of success with MIT-only licensing\n\nHowever, there were a variety of issues that have come up that make dual-licensing Bevy under both MIT and Apache-2.0 compelling:\n\nThe MIT license (arguably) requires binaries to reproduce countless copies of the same license boilerplate for every MIT library in use. Apache-2.0 allows us to compress the boilerplate into a single instance of the license.\nThe Apache-2.0 license has protections from patent trolls and an explicit contribution licensing clause.\nThe Rust ecosystem is largely Apache-2.0. Being available under that license is good for interoperation and opens the doors to upstreaming Bevy code into other projects (Rust, the async ecosystem, etc).\nThe Apache license is incompatible with GPLv2, but MIT is compatible.\n\nBevy Org Changes\n#\n\nMore pull request mergers!\n#\n\nI've been at my scalability limits for a while. It has been cough... challenging... to build the engine features I need to, review every single pull request quickly, and preserve my mental health. I've made it this far ... sometimes by overworking myself and sometimes by letting PRs sit unmerged for longer than I'd like. By scaling out, we can have our cake and eat it too!\n\n@mockersf now has merge rights for \"uncontroversial changes\"\n@alice-i-cecile now has merge rights for \"uncontroversial documentation changes\"\n\nNew issue labels\n#\n\nAfter much discussion about naming conventions and colors, we finally have a fresh new set of issue labels (loosely inspired by the rust repo). The Bevy Triage Team can finally express themselves fully!\nComprehensive CONTRIBUTING.md\n#\n\nauthors: @alice-i-cecile\nWe now have a relatively complete Contributors Guide. If you are interested in contributing code or documentation to Bevy, that is a great place to start!\nCI Build System Improvements\n#\n\nauthors: @mockersf, @NathanSWard, @NiklasEi\nWe made a ton of CI improvements this release:\n\nWe now fail on cargo doc warnings\nWe now use cargo deny to protect against vulnerabilities, duplicate dependencies, and invalid licenses\nPRs are now automatically labeled with the S-Needs-Triage label\nCi stability and speed improvements\nWe now check that our benchmarks build\nWe now assert compiler errors for compile_fail tests, giving us much stricter guarantees\nExamples are now run using lavapipe (instead of swiftshader) for faster CI validation\n\nWhat's Next For Bevy?\n#\n\nBevy development continues to pick up steam, and we have no intention to slow down now! In addition to the many RFCs we have in the works, we also plan on tackling the following over the next few months:\nThe \"Train\" Release Schedule\n#\n\nIn the last two Bevy releases we made massive, sweeping changes to core systems. Bevy 0.5 was \"the one where we rewrote Bevy ECS\". Bevy 0.6 was \"the one where we rewrote Bevy Render\". These massive reworks took time, and as a result held back a bunch of other useful features and bug fixes. They also created pressure to \"crunch\" and finish big features quickly to unblock releases. Crunching is unhealthy and should be avoided at all costs!\nThe Bevy Community has reached relative consensus that we should have a more regular, more predictable release schedule. One where large features can't gum up the system.\nFrom now on, we will cut releases approximately once every three months (as an upper bound ... sometimes we might release early if it makes sense). After the end of a release cycle, we will start preparing to cut a release. If there are small tweaks that need to be made or \"life happens\" ... we will happily postpone releases. But we won't hold releases back for \"big ticket\" items anymore.\nWe are balancing a lot of different concerns here:\n\nBuilding trust with Bevy contributors that their changes will land in a timely manner\nBuilding trust with Bevy users that they will receive regular updates and bug fixes\nGiving enough time between releases to cut down on churn in the Bevy Plugin ecosystem (Bevy isn't \"stable\" yet, but longer releases give reasonable windows of \"ecosystem stability\")\nProviding enough content in a release to generate \"hype\". Bevy release blog posts tend to be a \"rallying cry\" for the community and I don't want to lose that.\nEstablishing proper work / life balance for core developers (crunch is bad!)\n\nWe will refine this process over time and see what works best.\nMore Renderer Features\n#\n\n\nPost-Processing Stack / HDR / Bloom: HDR and bloom almost made it into Bevy 0.6, but we decided to hold them back so we can polish them a bit and build a proper \"modular post-processing stack\".\nSkeletal Animation: Ultimately Bevy will have a general purpose, property based animation system (we already have a working implementation). We've been holding off on adding skeletal animation, so we can slot it in to that system, but in retrospect that was a mistake. People need skeletal animation now. In the short term we will build a scoped 3d skeletal animation system, just to get the ball rolling. Then later we will port it to the general purpose system (whenever that is ready),\nScreen Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO): A popular and straightforward ambient occlusion approximation that can drastically improve render quality.\nGlobal Illumination: GI will provide a massive boost to the feel of \"realism\", so it is worth prioritizing at least one form of GI in the short term. This is a complicated topic and will require experimentation.\nCompressed Textures: This will make scenes load faster and cut down on GPU memory usage.\nShadow Filters and Cascades: Rob Swain (@superdump) has already done a lot of work in this area, so we will hopefully see that materialize in a Bevy release soon.\nPBR Shader Code Reuse: We will make it easier to define custom PBR shaders by making the PBR shader more modular and making it easier to import specific parts of the PBR shader.\n\nUI Refresh\n#\n\nWe will break ground on the Bevy Editor this year. To do that, we need a number of improvements to Bevy UI:\n\nImproved \"data driven UI\" (potentially \"reactive\")\nA solid set of pre-constructed widgets\nGenerally improved UX\n\nWe now have a plethora of UI experiments in the Bevy community. Over the next few months we will refine our scope and begin the process of \"selecting a winner\".\nAsset Preprocessing\n#\n\nPreprocessing assets is a critical part of a production game engine. It cuts down on startup times, reduces our CPU and GPU memory footprint, enables more complicated development workflows, makes it easier to ship assets with games, and cuts down on the final size of a deployed game. We've made it this far without an asset preprocessing system ... but barely. Solving this problem ASAP is a high priority for me.\nScene Improvements\n#\n\nNested scenes, property overrides, inline assets, and nicer syntax are all on the agenda. We already have a number of working experiments in these areas, so we should see relatively quick progress here.\nThe New Bevy Book\n#\n\nThe current Bevy Book is a great way to learn how to set up Bevy and dip your toes into writing Bevy Apps. But it barely scratches the surface of what Bevy can do.\nTo solve this problem @alice-i-cecile has started working on a new Bevy Book, with the goal of being a complete learning resource for Bevy. If you are interested in helping out, please reach out to them!\nThe Bevy Monthly Newsletter\n#\n\nThe Bevy Community is a vibrant and active place. Currently most community content is posted in the #showcase section of The Bevy Discord. The upcoming Monthly Bevy Newsletter will be a consolidated, shareable resource that we will post to places like Reddit and Twitter.\nSupport Bevy\n#\n\nSponsorships help make my full time work on Bevy sustainable.

You can check out Quick Start Guide to get started. Bevy is also free and open source forever! You can grab the full source code on GitHub. Check out Bevy Assets for a collection of community-developed plugins, games, and learning resources.\nTo update an existing Bevy App or Plugin to Bevy 0.7, check out our 0.6 to 0.7 Migration Guide.\nAs always, there are a ton of new features, bug fixes, and quality of life tweaks in this release, but here are some of the highlights:\n\nSkeletal animation and mesh skinning\nGLTF animation importing\nUnlimited* point lights in a scene\nImproved clustered forward rendering: dynamic/adaptive clustering and faster, more accurate cluster assignment\nCompressed texture support (KTX2 / DDS / .basis): load more textures in a scene, faster\nCompute shader / pipeline specialization: Bevy's flexible shader system was ported to compute shaders, enabling hot reloading, shader defs, and shader imports\nRender to texture: cameras can now be configured to render to a texture instead of a window\nFlexible mesh vertex layouts in shaders\nECS improvements: Order systems using their names, Query::many_mut, use conflicting parameters in systems via ParamSets, WorldQuery derives\nDocumentation improvements: better examples, more doc tests and more coverage\nMore audio control: pause, volume, speed, and looping\nPower usage options to enable only updating Bevy Apps when input occurs\n\nSkeletal Animation\n#\n\nauthors: @james7132, @mockersf, @lassade, @Looooong\nBevy finally supports 3D skeletal animation!\n\nScene Credits: Tanabata evening - Kyoto inspired city scene by Mathias Tossens is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution. Character model and animation are royalty free assets from Mixamo.\n\nSkeletal animations can now be played, paused, scrubbed, looped, reversed, and speed controlled using the new AnimationPlayer component and AnimationClip asset:\n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct Animations {\n    dance: Handle&lt;AnimationClip&gt;,\n}\n\nfn start_dancing(mut query: Query&lt;(&amp;Animations, &amp;mut AnimationPlayer)&gt;) {\n    for (animations, mut animation_player) in query.iter_mut() {\n        animation_player.play(animations.dance.clone());\n    }\n}\n\nAnimationPlayer can also be used to animate arbitrary Transform components, not just skeletons!\nThis critical feature has been a long time coming, but we wanted to build it in a way that meshed nicely with the new Bevy renderer and didn't just \"hack things in\". This builds on our new Flexible Mesh Vertex Layouts, Shader Imports, and Material systems, which ensures that this logic is flexible and reusable, even with non-standard meshes and custom render pipelines.\nAnd we're just getting started! Multi-track animation blending and higher level animation state management should arrive in the very near future. Now is a great time to start contributing animation features to Bevy. We've smashed through most of the foundational technical hurdles and what remains is largely high level api design choices. We already have a couple of draft RFCs open in these areas: Animation Composition and Animation Primitives. Feel free to join the conversation!\nGLTF Animation Importing\n#\n\nauthors: @mockersf\nBevy's GLTF importer was extended to import GLTF animations into the new AnimationPlayer system. This supports both \"skeletal animation\" and arbitrary transform animations:\n\nstruct FoxAnimations {\n    walk: Handle&lt;AnimationClip&gt;,\n}\n\nfn setup(mut commands: Commands) {\n    commands.spawn_scene(asset_server.load(\"models/animated/Fox.glb#Scene0\"));\n    commands.insert_resource(FoxAnimations {\n        walk: asset_server.load(\"models/animated/Fox.glb#Animation0\"),\n    });\n}\n\nfn play_on_load(\n    animations: Res&lt;FoxAnimations&gt;,\n    mut players: Query&lt;&amp;mut AnimationPlayer, Added&lt;AnimationPlayer&gt;&gt;,\n) {\n    for mut player in players.iter_mut() {\n        player.play(animations.walk.clone()).repeat();\n    }\n}\n\nUnlimited* Point Lights\n#\n\nauthors: Rob Swain (@superdump), @robtfm\nBevy can now render scenes with arbitrary numbers of point lights on platforms that support storage buffers (which is basically everything but WebGL). In the last Bevy release (0.6) we added Clustered Forward Rendering, which is a rendering technique that optimizes each fragment's light calculation costs by assigning lights to sub-volumes of the visible volume, called \"clusters\". However in the interest of platform compatibility (WebGL), we initially limited ourselves to 256 lights because that is what fit in a uniform buffer binding.\nIn Bevy 0.7, we added the ability to automatically \"upgrade\" to using unbounded storage buffers for Clustered Forward Rendering on platforms that support them, enabling unlimited* point lights. There is an asterisk there because in practice this is limited by memory and hardware constraints.\nLight Clustering Features and Optimizations\n#\n\nauthors: Rob Swain (@superdump), @robtfm, @dataphract, @cart\nWith the upper limit of 256 point lights removed, the only limit on lights is what the hardware can support and bottlenecks in our algorithms. To increase the number of lights, we made a number of optimizations to our clustering algorithms.\n\nDynamic Light Clusters\n\nBy default cluster x/y slices are now dynamically configured based on the lights in the scene, which can significantly increase performance in some scenes.\nThe clustering behavior is now also user-configurable as FixedZ (the new default dynamic x/y behavior, fixing the number of z slices), custom fixed x/y/z slice values, single-cluster, and \"no clustering\", giving you control when you know a certain cluster configuration will perform even better.\nAdditionally, in 0.6 the visible volume that is covered by all the clusters basically matched the full visible volume of the view frustum. This meant that if all the point lights were in the foreground, all the clusters beyond the lights were wasted space. In 0.7, it is possible to limit the far bound to be closer than the camera far bound, which means the lights can be spread across more clusters, which can significantly increase rendering performance.\n\n\nIterative Sphere Refinement: Bevy now uses the Just Cause 3 iterative sphere refinement approach to cluster assignment, which gives us a ~10% performance increase on some benchmarks and more accurate clustering (which can also improve render performance).\nLight Frustum Change Detection: We now use Bevy ECS's change detection feature to only recalculate the view frustum of lights that have changed.\nCluster Assignment Optimizations: The cluster assignment data access patterns and data structures received a variety of tweaks that improved performance.\n\nHere is a video illustrating a progression from the old limit of 256 point lights to 25,000 point lights at 60fps!\n(Note that the 25,000 lights example disables the debug light spheres to ensure that light calculations are the bottleneck)\n\nAnd we have even more clustering optimizations in the works!\nConfigurable Light Visibility\n#\n\nauthors: @robtfm\nLights can now be turned on and off using Bevy's standard Visibility component:\ncommands.spawn(PointLightBundle {\n    visibility: Visibility {\n        is_visible: false,\n    },\n    ..default()\n});\n\nCompressed GPU Textures\n#\n\nauthors: Rob Swain (@superdump)\nAs scenes grow larger, so do their assets. Compressing these assets is a great way to save space. The Amazon Bistro scene featured below has well over 1GB of compressed textures.\nPNG is a popular compressed format, but it must be decompressed before the GPU can use it. This can be a slow process for large scenes. Those textures are then used in their uncompressed form, taking up large quantities of limited memory. Compressed GPU textures can be used directly in their compressed format by the GPU and can be loaded without any additional processing. This reduces load times significantly. As they remain compressed, this also reduces RAM usage significantly.\nThe Bistro scene took a total of 12.9s to load with PNG textures, but only 1.5s with compressed textures - taking approximately a tenth of the load time! The total RAM usage was ~12GB with uncompressed textures, and 5GB with compressed textures, less than half!\nThe benefits don't stop there either - because the textures are compressed and can be used by the GPU in that format, reading from them uses less memory bandwidth, which can bring performance benefits. The Bistro scene gains about 10% in frame rate from using compressed textures.\n\nAnother benefit is that mipmaps are supported, which makes for smoother, less noisy textures. Bevy currently doesn't have support for automatically generating mipmaps for uncompressed textures, so using compressed textures is a nice way to have mipmaps now!\nIn summary, Bevy now supports loading compressed textures from .dds, .ktx2, and .basis files. This includes support for the standard ASTC, BCn, and ETC2 formats, as well as 'universal' formats like ETC1S and UASTC that can be transcoded to the standard formats supported by specific systems at runtime. The glTF loader was also extended to support loading these formats.\nThese features can be enabled using the dds, ktx2, and basis-universal cargo features.\nRender To Texture\n#\n\nauthors: @HackerFoo\nBevy now has initial support for rendering to texture by configuring the render_target field on Camera. This enables scenarios such as mirrors, split screen, 2d UI in 3d space, portals, etc.\n\nNote that the current implementation is relatively low level. It will generally require interacting with Bevy's Render Graph and defining new camera types. If you would like to use this feature now, the render_to_texture example illustrates the steps required. We have plans for \"high level render targets\" that will make rendering to textures possible in just a few lines of code. Stay tuned for details!\nBevy-Native Compute Shaders\n#\n\nauthors: @Ku95\nBevy's flexible asset-driven shader system was ported to compute shaders/pipelines, enabling hot reloading, shader defs, shader imports, and pipeline specialization based on user-configurable keys:\n#import \"shaders/game_of_life_texture_bind_group.wgsl\"\n\n[[stage(compute), workgroup_size(8, 8, 1)]]\nfn game_of_life_update([[builtin(global_invocation_id)]] invocation_id: vec3&lt;u32&gt;) {\n    let location = vec2&lt;i32&gt;(i32(invocation_id.x), i32(invocation_id.y));\n    let alive = is_location_alive(location);\n\n    // shader defs are configurable at runtime, prompting new variants of the shader to be compiled\n#ifdef WRITE_OUTPUT\n    storageBarrier();\n    textureStore(texture, location, vec4&lt;f32&gt;(f32(alive)));\n#endif\n}\n\nFlexible Mesh Vertex Layouts\n#\n\nauthors: @cart, @parasyte\nIn Bevy 0.7, it is now easy to make shaders support any Mesh vertex layout and arbitrary vertex attributes. Bevy's \"shader pipeline specialization\" system was extended to support \"specializing on mesh vertex layouts\".\nFor most Bevy users, this means that Materials, including the built in StandardMaterial and custom shader materials now support arbitrary Meshes automatically, provided those Meshes have the vertex attributes required by the material shaders. It also means that if your Mesh is missing any attribute required by its material, rendering can fail gracefully.\nWe also made use of this system to implement joint weights and indices for our new Skeletal Animation implementation.\nFor Bevy users that like to write lower level graphics pipelines, this feature makes it possible to easily and efficiently specialize your pipelines according to Mesh vertex layouts:\nimpl SpecializedMeshPipeline for SomeCustomPipeline {\n    type Key = SomeCustomKey;\n\n    fn specialize(\n        &amp;self,\n        key: Self::Key,\n        layout: &amp;MeshVertexBufferLayout,\n    ) -&gt; Result&lt;RenderPipelineDescriptor, SpecializedMeshPipelineError&gt; {\n        // this is a layout that matches the requirements requested,\n        // but catered to whatever mesh is currently being rendered\n        let vertex_buffer_layout = layout.get_layout(&amp;[\n            Mesh::ATTRIBUTE_POSITION.at_shader_location(0),\n            Mesh::ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL.at_shader_location(1),\n            Mesh::ATTRIBUTE_UV_0.at_shader_location(2),\n        ])?;\n\n        Ok(RenderPipelineDescriptor {\n            vertex: VertexState {\n                buffers: vec![vertex_buffer_layout],\n                /* define the rest of the vertex state here */\n            },\n            /* define the rest of the mesh pipeline here */\n        })\n    }\n\nCamera Marker Components\n#\n\nauthors: @jakobhellermann\nIn Bevy 0.7, Cameras now use the \"marker component\" pattern to determine the \"camera type\" (ex: 3D, 2D, UI), rather than using string names.\nThis means that it is now cheaper and easier to select cameras of a specific type:\nfn move_3d_camera_system(transforms: Query&lt;&amp;mut Transform, With&lt;Camera3d&gt;&gt;) {\n    for mut camera in transforms.iter_mut() {\n        // move camera here\n    }\n}\n\nErgonomic System Ordering\n#\n\nauthors: @cart, @aevyrie, @alice-i-cecile, @DJMcNab\nBevy uses \"labels\" to define ordering constraints between its ECS systems when they run in parallel. In previous versions of Bevy, the only way to order systems was to define custom labels:\n#[derive(SystemLabel, Clone, Hash, Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]\nstruct UpdateVelocity;\n\napp\n  .add_system(update_velocity.label(UpdateVelocity))\n  .add_system(movement.after(UpdateVelocity))\n\nIn Bevy 0.7, manually defining labels is no longer required. You can order systems using functions, just like you do when adding systems!\napp\n  .add_system(update_velocity)\n  .add_system(movement.after(update_velocity))\n\nThis is accomplished by \"auto-labeling\" systems with their TypeId (the label type is SystemTypeIdLabel). Internally ordering still uses labels.\nThe Bevy ECS labeling system is powerful and there are still legitimate use cases for custom labels (such as labeling multiple systems with the same label and exporting a stable public API as a plugin author). But most common use cases can take advantage of the ergonomic auto-labeling functionality.\nDefault Shorthand\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\nBevy makes heavy use of Rust's struct update pattern in combination with the Default trait when initializing entities. This significantly reduces the amount of typing required by enabling developers to only fill in the fields they want to change.\nThe standard way of doing this is to write out ..Default::default():\ncommands.spawn_bundle(SpriteBundle {\n    texture: some_texture,\n    ..Default::default()\n})\n\nThis is much better than filling in each field's component manually:\ncommands.spawn(SpriteBundle {\n    texture: some_texture,\n    sprite: Default::default(),\n    transform: Default::default(),\n    global_transform: Default::default(),\n    visibility: Default::default(),\n});\n\nHowever this can feel repetitive when you're doing it for tens or hundreds of entities. We added a way to make this even easier, without needing to resort to macros:\ncommands.spawn_bundle(SpriteBundle {\n    texture: some_texture,\n    ..default()\n})\n\nThis is equivalent in functionality to ..Default::default(), it's just more compressed. And you can still use the longer form if you prefer. The default() function is included in Bevy's prelude, so you don't need to manually import it. Ergonomics for the win!\nQuery::many\n#\n\nauthors: @alice-i-cecile\nBevy ECS solves a hard problem: providing easy and fast access to data in parallel while still respecting Rust's strict mutability and ownership rules. Since our first release, we've supported efficiently accessing specific entities in our ECS Queries:\nstruct SomeEntities {\n    a: Entity,\n    b: Entity,\n}\n\nfn system(mut query: Query&lt;&amp;mut Transform&gt;, entities: Res&lt;SomeEntities&gt;) {\n    let a_transform = query.get_mut(entities.a).unwrap();\n}\n\nHowever, to respect Rust's mutability rules, we need to disallow apis that might produce \"aliased mutability\". Seasoned Bevy users will probably recognize this Rust borrow checker error:\nfn system(mut query: Query&lt;&amp;mut Transform&gt;, entities: Res&lt;SomeEntities&gt;) {\n    let a_transform = query.get_mut(entities.a).unwrap();\n    // This line fails to compile because `query` is already mutably borrowed above\n    let b_transform = query.get_mut(entities.b).unwrap();\n}\n\nYou know Entity A and Entity B are different entities at runtime. But Rust's borrow checker has no way to know that at compile time! I'm sure you can imagine game development scenarios that would benefit from having mutable access to multiple components at the same time. This borrow checker restriction was a common pain point and the workarounds were ... not fun (using scopes to ensure conflicting accesses are dropped, copying data, re-querying things, etc).\nFortunately, Bevy 0.7 introduces a brand new set of apis to save the day!\nfn system(mut query: Query&lt;&amp;mut Transform&gt;, entities: Res&lt;SomeEntities&gt;) {\n    // Takes an array of entities and returns an array of mutable Query results\n    // This will panic if there are entity conflicts or the entities do not exist\n    let [a_transform, b_transform] = query.many_mut([entities.a, entities.b]);\n}\n\nThere are plenty of variants:\n// Same as many_mut, but returns a Result instead of panicking\nif let Ok([a_transform, b_transform]) = query.get_many_mut([entities.a, entities.b]) {\n}\n\n// There are also immutable/read-only variants\nlet [a_transform, b_transform] = query.many([entities.a, entities.b]);\nif let Ok([a_transform, b_transform]) = query.get_many([entities.a, entities.b]) {\n}\n\nAnd they all support arbitrary numbers of entities:\nlet [a, b, c] = query.many([entity_a, entity_b, entity_c]);\n\nParamSets\n#\n\nauthors: @bilsen\nTo prevent aliased mutability, Bevy ECS disallows systems that have parameters that conflict with each other. For example, if two Queries both request write access to the same component in the same \"archetype\", that could result in aliased mutable access, so Bevy disallows that system and errors out.\nPrevious versions of Bevy supported conflicting Queries in the same system using QuerySets, which only allow access to one Query in the set at a time:\n// These queries could each return a mutable A component for the same entity, so they must be put in a set to be considered a valid system. \nfn system(mut set: QuerySet&lt;(QueryState&lt;(&amp;mut A, &amp;B)&gt;, QueryState&lt;(&amp;mut A, &amp;C)&gt;)&gt;) {\n    for (a, b) in set.q0().iter_mut() {\n    }\n}\n\nBevy 0.7 removes QuerySet in favor of ParamSet, which generalizes the QuerySet pattern for any system parameter:\nfn system(mut set: ParamSet&lt;(Query&lt;(&amp;mut A, &amp;B)&gt;, Query&lt;(&amp;mut A, &amp;C)&gt;)&gt;) {\n    for (a, b) in set.p0().iter_mut() {\n    }\n}\n\nBut ParamSets aren't just limited to Queries! Consider this example, where the EventWriter&lt;Jump&gt; parameter (which internally accesses the Events&lt;Jump&gt; resource) conflicts with the raw access to that resource. Previously, expressing this wouldn't be possible. But with ParamSets, it is!\nfn system(mut set: ParamSet&lt;(EventWriter&lt;Jump&gt;, ResMut&lt;Events&lt;Jump&gt;&gt;)&gt;) {\n    for jump_event in set.p1().drain() {\n    }\n}\n\nWe still recommend avoiding ParamSets where possible for clarity's sake. But every so often they are a necessary and useful tool!\nDeref / DerefMut Derives\n#\n\nauthors: @MrGVSV\nRust encourages the use of the newtype pattern when expanding a type with new functionality or meaning. This is also a useful tool in Bevy:\n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct Items(Vec&lt;Item&gt;);\n\nfn give_sword(mut query: Query&lt;&amp;mut Items&gt;) { \n    for mut items in query.iter_mut() {\n        items.0.push(Item::new(\"Flaming Poisoning Raging Sword of Doom\"));\n    }\n}\n\nThis works just fine, but that 0 at the end of items.0 sticks out like a sore thumb. Many of us in the Bevy Org think .0 has no place in public apis. But the newtype pattern is still useful! Ideally, Rust would provide a way to express that Items is a new type, while transparently provided access to the Vec&lt;Item&gt; stored within. There are designs being discussed by the Rust team, but we don't want to wait for nice things!\nFortunately, the Deref / DerefMut traits in std provide the behavior we want. Users can already manually implement these traits, but for such a common pattern, we decided that providing our own trait derives was worth it. In Bevy 0.7, you can now derive Deref and DerefMut, enabling much nicer public apis:\n#[derive(Component, Deref, DerefMut)]\nstruct Items(Vec&lt;Item&gt;);\n\nfn give_sword(mut query: Query&lt;&amp;mut Items&gt;) { \n    for mut items in query.iter_mut() {\n        // No more .0!\n        items.push(Item::new(\"Flaming Poisoning Raging Sword of Doom\"));\n    }\n}\n\nAstute std doc readers might notice that the Rust team recommends only using Deref/DerefMut for smart pointers, to avoid confusion. Components like Items are not smart pointers. We choose to ignore this advice, as this pattern works, is already widely used in the Rust ecosystem, and Good UX Comes First.\nWorldQuery Derives\n#\n\nauthors: @mvlabat\nSometimes when building Bevy Apps you might find yourself repeating the same sets of components over and over in your queries:\nfn move_players(mut players: Query&lt;(&amp;mut Transform, &amp;mut Velocity, &amp;mut PlayerStats)&gt;) {\n    for (transform, velocity, stats) in players.iter_mut() {\n    }\n}\n\nfn player_gravity(mut players: Query&lt;(Entity, &amp;mut Transform, &amp;mut Velocity, &amp;mut PlayerStats)&gt;) {\n    for (entity, transform, velocity, stats) in players.iter_mut() {\n    }\n}\n\nMaybe you've gotten tired of typing the same components over and over. In Bevy 0.7, you can now easily create your own custom WorldQuery trait implementations with the WorldQuery derive:\n#[derive(WorldQuery)]\n#[world_query(mutable)]\nstruct PlayerMovementQuery&lt;'w&gt; {\n    transform: &amp;'w mut Transform,\n    velocity: &amp;'w mut Velocity,\n    stats: &amp;'w mut PlayerStats,\n}\n\nfn move_players(mut players: Query&lt;PlayerMovementQuery&gt;) {\n    for player in players.iter_mut() {\n    }\n}\n\nfn player_gravity(mut players: Query&lt;(Entity, PlayerMovementQuery)&gt;) {\n    for (entity, player) in players.iter_mut() {\n    }\n}\n\nWorld::resource\n#\n\nauthors: @alice-i-cecile\nWe've noticed that the majority of direct World resource access immediately unwraps the results of get_resource:\nlet time = world.get_resource::&lt;Time&gt;().unwrap();\n\nIn Bevy 0.7 we added an ergonomic variant that internally panics:\nlet time = world.resource::&lt;Time&gt;();\n\nThere is also a mutable variant:\nlet mut time = world.resource_mut::&lt;Time&gt;();\n\nThe get_resource variants are still available for cases where users still want to manually handle the returned Option.\nAnyOf Queries\n#\n\nauthors: @TheRawMeatball\nBevy ECS Queries now support AnyOf, which will return results for entities that match \"any of\" the given component queries:\nfn system(query: Query&lt;AnyOf&lt;(&amp;A, &amp;B)&gt;&gt;) {\n    for (a, b) in query.iter() {\n        // Either A or B is guaranteed to be Some\n        assert!(a.is_some() || b.is_some())\n    }\n}\n\nFor the example above AnyOf will return entities that have A and not B, B and not A, and both A and B.\n&amp;World System Param\n#\n\nauthors: @bilsen\nIt is now possible for \"normal systems\" have &amp;World system params, which provide full read-only access to the entire World:\nfn system(world: &amp;World, transforms: Query&lt;&amp;Transform&gt;) {\n}\n\nJust keep in mind that &amp;World will conflict with any mutable Query:\n\n    fn invalid_system(world: &amp;World, transforms: Query&lt;&amp;mut Transform&gt;) {\n}\n\n\n\nIn these cases, consider using our new ParamSets to resolve the conflict:\nfn valid_system(set: ParamSet&lt;(&amp;World, Query&lt;&amp;mut Transform&gt;)&gt;) {\n}\n\nECS Soundness / Correctness Improvements\n#\n\nauthors: @BoxyUwU, @TheRawMeatball, @bjorn3\nBevy ECS received a solid number of soundness and correctness bug fixes this release:\n\nRemoved unsound lifetime annotations on EntityMut and Query, which could be used to get aliased mutability in some situations.\nLabeled World::entities_mut unsafe (because manually modifying entity metadata can invalidate safety assumptions)\nRemoved unsound World::components_mut (which allowed replacing component metadata, invalidating assumptions made elsewhere in World)\nFixed a World::resource_scope soundness bug\nUsed ManuallyDrop in resource id initialization instead of forget() to avoid invalidating a data pointer before it is used.\n\nWe now also run the miri interpreter on Bevy ECS in our CI to help detect and prevent future soundness / correctness issues.\nAs Bevy ECS matures, our bar for unsafe code blocks and soundness must also mature. Bevy ECS will probably never be 100% free of unsafe code blocks because we are modeling parallel data access that Rust cannot reason about without our help. But we are committed to removing as much unsafe code as we can and improving the quality and scope of our unsafe code.\nAudio Control\n#\n\nauthors: @mockersf\nBevy's audio system has been in a ... minimalist state since our first release. Until now, it only supported pressing \"play\" on audio assets. Third party plugins such as bevy_kira_audio have filled in the gaps with much more flexible audio solutions.\nIn Bevy 0.7 we've started expanding what our built in audio plugin can do. It is now possible to pause, adjust volume, and set playback speed using AudioSink assets.\nPlaying audio now returns a Handle&lt;AudioSink&gt; which can be used to play/pause/set_speed/set_volume:\nstruct BeautifulMusic(Handle&lt;AudioSink&gt;);\n\nfn setup_audio(\n    asset_server: Res&lt;AssetServer&gt;,\n    audio: Res&lt;Audio&gt;,\n    audio_sinks: Res&lt;Assets&lt;AudioSink&gt;&gt;,\n) {\n    let music = asset_server.load(\"BeautifulMusic.ogg\");\n    // play audio and upgrade to a strong handle\n    let sink_handle = audio_sinks.get_handle(audio.play(music));\n    commands.insert_resource(BeautifulMusic(sink_handle));\n}\n\n// later in another system\nfn adjust_audio(music: Res&lt;BeautifulMusic&gt;, mut audio_sinks: ResMut&lt;Assets&lt;AudioSink&gt;&gt;) {\n    if let Some(sink) = audio_sinks.get(music.0) {\n        // pause playback\n        sink.pause();\n        // start playback again\n        sink.play();\n        // increase the volume\n        sink.set_volume(sink.volume() + 0.1);\n        // slow down playback\n        sink.set_speed(0.5);\n    }\n}\n\nYou can also now loop audio playback:\naudio.play_with_settings(music, PlaybackSettings::LOOP.with_volume(0.75));\n\nWe plan to continue iterating on these APIs with even more functionality and usability improvements!\nSprite Anchors\n#\n\nauthors: @mockersf\nSprite components can now define an Anchor point (also known as a \"pivot\" point), which determines the \"origin\" of the sprite. Sprites still default to a \"center\" origin, but this is now configurable:\ncommands.spawn_bundle(SpriteBundle {\n    texture: asset_server.load(\"bevy_logo.png\"),\n    sprite: Sprite {\n        anchor: Anchor::TopRight,\n        ..default()\n    },\n    ..default()\n});\n\n\nEventLoop Power Saving Modes\n#\n\nauthors: @aevyrie\nBy default Bevy will run updates \"as fast as it can\" (limited by the screen's refresh rate). This is great for most games, but some application types (such as GUI apps) need to prioritize CPU and GPU power usage.\nBevy 0.7 adds the ability to configure the [UpdateMode] in [WinitConfig] to configure how Bevy Apps run updates:\n\nContinuous: always update \"as soon as possible\" (honoring vsync configuration)\nReactive: only update when there is a window event, a redraw is requested, or a configurable wait time has elapsed\nReactiveLowPower: only update when there is user input (mouse movement, keyboard input, etc), a redraw is requested, or a configurable wait time has elapsed\n\nThese settings can be configured separately for focused windows and unfocused windows (enabling you to save power when a window loses focus).\nReactiveLowPower can significantly reduce power / resource usage, but it won't be suitable for every app type, as some apps need to assume that they are constantly being updated as quickly as possible. Therefore these settings are opt-in.\nThis app demos the various modes available. Note that Game mode was configured to lower its tick rate when it loses focus, which is not the default:\n\nDocumentation improvements\n#\n\nauthors: @alice-i-cecile and many more\nGreat docs make learning, using and building Bevy better.\nBut as a young engine, they're still a work-in-progress.\ndeny-missing-docs\n#\n\nOur docs team (led by @alice-i-cecile) has started to systematically fix that, with the help of Rust's #[warn(missing_docs)] lint.\nSince 0.6, we've fully documented (and prevented doc-regressions for):\n\nbevy_tasks by @james7132\nbevy_app by @dbearden\nbevy_dylib by @KDecay\nbevy_internal by @sheepyhead\n\nThere have been many other doc improvements over this time period as well, including the addition of many helpful doc tests, and our bar for docs in new code continues to rise.\nA huge thanks to everyone making Bevy's docs better.\nNew contributors\n#\n\nIf you're interested in contributing, the docs team is always ready to help new contributors get their first Bevy PR merged ASAP.\nThere have been a ton of new contributors who've helped out with docs, either as a writer or a reviewer.\nIf this is you: thanks!\nBetter examples\n#\n\nFor many people, the best way to learn a tool is to see it in action.\nWe've been steadily polishing our examples with better explanations, more coverage, and higher code quality.\nIf you're new to Bevy, check out the much-improved Breakout example!\nDev Docs\n#\n\nauthors: @james7132, @mockersf, @aevyrie\nWe now automatically deploy Bevy's main development branch to https://dev-docs.bevyengine.org whenever a change is merged. This will help Bevy documentation authors easily validate their changes. And \"bleeding edge\" Bevy users can learn about API changes we're working on.\n\nWebsite Improvements\n#\n\nauthors: @doup\nThe Bevy Book now has a much nicer pager widget that displays previous / next section names:\n\nWe also added an \"improve this page\" footer link to make it easier for Bevy Book readers to contribute changes.\nThe sidebar got an overhaul that improves clarity and makes it possible to open/close sections without clicking on them:\n\nThe responsiveness of the website has also been improved and some sections layout much better on mobile.\nScene Viewer Tool\n#\n\nauthors: Rob Swain (@superdump), @mockersf, @IceSentry, @jakobhellermann\nBevy now has a dedicated scene viewer tool that can load arbitrary GLTF scene files. If you check out the main Bevy repo you can try it out by running:\ncargo run --release --example scene_viewer /some/path/castle.gltf\n\nIt has a built in \"fly camera\" and has tools to play animations and toggle lights and shadows.\n\nSupport Bevy\n#\n\nSponsorships help make my full time work on Bevy sustainable.

You can check out our Quick Start Guide to try it today. It's free and open source forever! You can grab the full source code on GitHub. Check out Bevy Assets for a collection of community-developed plugins, games, and learning resources.\nTo update an existing Bevy App or Plugin to Bevy 0.8, check out our 0.7 to 0.8 Migration Guide.\nSince our last release a few months ago we've added a ton of new features, bug fixes, and quality of life tweaks, but here are some of the highlights:\n\nNew Material System: Custom shaders are now much easier to define, thanks to the new Material trait and AsBindGroup derive.\nCamera-driven Rendering: Each Camera now configures what it renders and how it renders it. Easily layer camera renders on top of each other, do split screen, or render to a texture in just a few lines of code.\nBuilt-in Shader Modularization: Many built-in shader types and functions are now importable. Notably, custom shaders can now import the PBR shader logic\nSpot Lights: A new light type that emits light in a cone shape from a fixed point.\nVisibility Inheritance: Hiding an entity now also hides all of its descendants in the hierarchy.\nUpgraded to wgpu 0.13: Uses a new, more ergonomic WGSL shader syntax.\nAutomatic Mesh Tangent Generation: If tangents are missing for a mesh, generate them with mikktspace.\nRenderer Optimizations: Parallel frustum culling and unstable sorts for unbatched render phases yielded some big wins!\nScene Bundle: Easily spawn scenes using a normal Bevy bundle and extend them with new components and children.\nScripting and Modding Progress: Untyped ECS APIs: A step toward 3rd party scripting language support! Interact with Bevy ECS internals directly via pointers.\nECS Query Ergonomics and Usability: Queries now implement IntoIter and mutable queries can be converted to immutable queries.\nECS Internals Refactors: Sweeping changes to Bevy ECS internals that make it simpler, safer, and easier to maintain.\nReflection Improvements: Support for reflecting more types, ECS resource reflection, untyped reflection, improved internals.\nHierarchy Commands: Hierarchy updates now use \"transactional commands\" to ensure hierarchy consistency at all times.\nBevy UI Now Uses Taffy:  We've swapped to (and help maintain) a collaborative fork of the now abandoned Stretch UI layout library. Exponential blow-up bug begone!\n\nNew Material System\n#\n\nauthors: @cart, @Wrapperup, @johanhelsing\nBevy has a brand new Material system that makes defining custom shaders a breeze. Bevy's previous material system required hundreds of lines of \"mid-level\" boilerplate. This was never the long term plan, just an intermediate step. In Bevy 0.8, custom shader materials are as simple as this:\n#[derive(AsBindGroup, TypeUuid, Clone)]\n#[uuid = \"f690fdae-d598-45ab-8225-97e2a3f056e0\"]\npub struct CoolMaterial {\n    #[uniform(0)]\n    color: Color,\n    #[texture(1)]\n    #[sampler(2)]\n    color_texture: Handle&lt;Image&gt;,\n}\n\n// The Material trait has many optional functions for configuration.\n// In this case, all we need to set is a fragment shader. Ergonomics!\nimpl Material for CoolMaterial {\n    fn fragment_shader() -&gt; ShaderRef {\n        \"cool_material.wgsl\".into()\n    }\n}\n\nAnd the cool_material.wgsl shader:\nstruct CoolMaterial {\n    color: vec4&lt;f32&gt;,\n};\n\n@group(1) @binding(0)\nvar&lt;uniform&gt; material: CoolMaterial;\n@group(1) @binding(1)\nvar color_texture: texture_2d&lt;f32&gt;;\n@group(1) @binding(2)\nvar color_sampler: sampler;\n\n@fragment\nfn fragment(\n    #import bevy_pbr::mesh_vertex_output\n) -&gt; @location(0) vec4&lt;f32&gt; {\n    return material.color * textureSample(color_texture, color_sampler, uv);\n}\n\nAnd just like that, we have a configurable shader material!\nThis can be used to create whatever effects you want! For example: @DGriffin91 made this cool \"glowing orb\" effect:\n\nThey also made a nice video tutorial outlining how to create this material.\nThis is thanks to the new AsBindGroup trait / derive, which does all of the hard work of converting the material to GPU-compatible datatypes, writing them to the GPU, and creating the final BindGroup. The AsBindGroup trait is powerful: it supports combining multiple fields into the same uniform binding, configuring texture binding types (2D, 3D, filtering, etc), and more. For details, check out the AsBindGroup docs.\nAll built-in materials, such as the PBR StandardMaterial have been ported to use this new system. We strive to make Bevy \"internals\" the same as user code, and this is no exception! Material also works seamlessly with our more advanced shader features, such as shader pipeline specialization.\nThere is also an equivalent Material2d trait, which enables custom materials in 2D.\nCamera-Driven Rendering\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\nIn previous versions of Bevy, Cameras were selected and run as a part of one \"global\" RenderGraph. There could only be one \"active\" camera of a given type, and that camera could only render to one target. The only way to render from multiple perspectives at the same time was to manually extend the render graph with duplicate logic. This was full of complicated low-level renderer boilerplate that wasn't approachable for the average Bevy user.\nIn Bevy 0.8, each Camera now configures what it renders, how it renders, and what it renders to. An enabled camera will start a new run of a RenderGraph to a specified RenderTarget. The render graph defines modular render logic for the given camera and the render target defines the window or texture the graph will render to.\nThis makes scenarios that were previously hundreds (or thousands) of lines of code as simple as setting a few fields on the Camera entity:\nRender to Textures\n#\n\nRendering a Camera to a texture is now a single line of code:\ncamera.target = RenderTarget::Image(image_handle);\n\nThis enables too many scenarios to count: portals, rendering UI to a texture and rendering it in 3d space, in-game security cameras, real-time player portraits rendered in UI widgets ... the sky is the limit!\nHere is an example of a \"portal effect\":\n\nThis is accomplished by rendering a second camera to a texture, synchronizing its orientation with the main player's camera, and using that texture in the main camera's scene.\nSplit Screen\n#\n\nEach Camera now has an optional Viewport, which if set will draw to a section of a RenderTarget instead of the whole. If you spawn two active cameras and set each camera's Viewport to draw to half of the window, you have simple, painless split screen!\n\nLayered Rendering\n#\n\nCameras can now be layered on top of each other using the new \"camera priority\" field:\n// This camera defaults to priority 0 and is rendered \"first\" / \"at the back\" \ncommands.spawn_bundle(Camera3dBundle::default());\ncommands.spawn_bundle(Camera3dBundle {\n    camera_3d: Camera3d {\n        // don't clear the color while rendering this camera\n        clear_color: ClearColorConfig::None,\n        ..default()\n    },\n    camera: Camera {\n        // renders after / on top of the main camera\n        priority: 1,\n        ..default()\n    },\n    ..default()\n});\n\n\"Priority\" determines the order cameras are drawn in. The \"portal\" effect in the render to textures example above uses priority to render the \"portal\" camera first, ensuring it is ready to be used by the main camera.\nHere is a simple example of two cameras rendering to the same window:\n\nThis can be used for things like \"custom UI passes\", \"minimaps\", etc.\nErgonomic Target Size Access\n#\n\nCameras now store their RenderTarget size locally, which makes retrieving the size much simpler:\n// Much nicer than needing to look up the size on the target Window or Image manually,\n// like you had to in previous Bevy versions!\nlet target_size = camera.logical_target_size();\nlet viewport_size = camera.logical_viewport_size();\n\nThis also means that converting world to screen coordinates for a camera is much easier than it used to be:\n// Bevy 0.7 (old)\ncamera.world_to_screen(windows, images, camera_transform, world_position);\n\n// Bevy 0.8 (new)\ncamera.world_to_viewport(camera_transform, world_position);\n\nNew Camera Bundles\n#\n\nThe old OrthographicCameraBundle and PerspectiveCameraBundle have been replaced with Camera3dBundle and Camera2dBundle. In most cases migration should be as simple as replacing the old names with the new ones. 3D cameras default to \"perspective\" projections, but they can still be switched to orthographic using the new Projection component in the bundle.\nNo More CameraUiBundle!\n#\n\nBevy UI now no longer needs a separate camera entity to work. UI \"just works\" for all camera types and can be enabled or disabled per-camera using the UiCameraConfig component.\ncommands\n    .spawn_bundle(Camera3dBundle::default())\n    .insert(UiCameraConfig {\n        show_ui: false,\n    });\n\nCustom Render Graphs\n#\n\nThe default 2D and 3D RenderGraphs for each Camera can be overridden by setting the CameraRenderGraph component:\ncommands.spawn_bundle(Camera3dBundle {\n    camera_render_graph: CameraRenderGraph::new(some_custom_graph),\n    ..default()\n})\n\nThis enables you to draw the camera with whatever custom render logic you need! For example, you could replace the built in clustered-forward-rendering with deferred rendering. Note that this generally won't be required: most custom rendering scenarios will be covered by high-level Materials or extending the built-in render graphs. And using the default render graph will ensure maximum compatibility with other plugins.\nEnabling / Disabling Cameras\n#\n\nIf a camera is \"active\", it will render to its RenderTarget. To activate or deactivate a camera, set the new is_active field:\ncamera.is_active = true;\n\nRenderLayers\n#\n\nBevy's existing RenderLayers system can be used to tell a Camera to only render entities on specific layers. Camera-Driven Rendering pairs nicely with this feature. This enables rendering one set of entities to one camera and another set of entities to another camera. We've ported the RenderLayers system to all entities with Visibility, so this will all Just Work™.\nSpotlights\n#\n\nauthors: @robtfm\nBevy now has a SpotLight entity type, which emits light in a cone shape from a point in space.\n\nVisibility Inheritance\n#\n\nauthors: @james7132, @cart\nVisibility in entity hierarchies (using the Visibility component) now propagates down the hierarchy. This is hugely useful, as entities in a game often have many entities nested beneath them. A \"player entity\" is often made up of many pieces: the player sprite or mesh, what the player is wearing / holding, visual effects, etc.\nVisibility inheritance means that you only need to hide the top level \"player\" entity in your code and everything beneath it will be hidden for you.\nThis \"flight helmet\" scene consists of many \"pieces\" nested under the main helmet entity. Hiding all of these \"sub entities\" is as now as easy as hiding the top level helmet entity.\n\nfn hide_helmets(mut helmet_visibilities: Query&lt;&amp;mut Visibility, With&lt;Helmet&gt;&gt;) {\n    let mut helmet_visibility = helmet_visibilities.single_mut();\n    helmet_visibility.is_visible = false;\n}\n\nIn past versions of Bevy, you had to hide each piece manually!\nThe \"inherited visibility\" is computed in the PostUpdate stage and stored on the ComputedVisibility component. ComputedVisibility now has the following functions:\n\nis_visible_in_hierarchy(): Whether or not the entity is visible according to \"visibility inheritance\".\nis_visible_in_view(): Whether or not the entity is visible in any view. This is used for culling entities in cases like \"frustum culling\".\nis_visible(): The canonical place to determine whether or not an entity will be drawn. Combines \"view visibility\" and \"hierarchy visibility\".\n\nSpatialBundle and VisibilityBundle\n#\n\nauthors: @mockersf, @rparrett\nWith the addition of Visibility Inheritance comes the constraint that visibility propagation requires all elements in the hierarchy to have the appropriate visibility components. When constructing scenes, developers often want to group entities under parent \"organizational\" entities, which exist solely to group entities together, reposition them, and hide them as a unit. These \"organizational\" entities still require visibility components to propagate the Transform and Visibility to GlobalTransform and ComputedVisibility (respectively).\nTo make this easy, we've added a new SpatialBundle, which adds the components mentioned above. This allows the entity to configure and propagate visibility and transform data without incurring the cost of actually rendering it.\ncommands\n    // This entity controls the position and visibility of the entities beneath it.\n    .spawn_bundle(SpatialBundle {\n        transform: Transform::from_xyz(10.0, 20.0, 30.0),\n        visibility: Visibility {\n            is_visible: true,\n        },\n        ..default()\n    }).with_children(|parent| {\n        parent\n            .spawn_bundle(TableBundle::default())\n            .spawn_bundle(ShopKeeperBundle::default())\n            .spawn_bundle(PotionBundle::default());\n    });\n\nTo ensure visibility and transforms are propagated, make sure the whole hierarchy (root -&gt; leaf) has these components:\ncommands\n    .spawn_bundle(SpatialBundle::default())\n    .with_children(|parent| {\n        parent\n            .spawn_bundle(SpatialBundle::default())\n            .with_children(|parent| {\n                parent.spawn_bundle(SpatialBundle::default());\n            });\n    });\n\nIf you know you don't need Transform propagation (or your entity already has those components), you can instead use the new VisibilityBundle, which only adds the components required for visibility propagation.\nBuilt-in Shader Modularization\n#\n\nauthors: Rob Swain (@superdump)\nIn Bevy 0.8, we've started modularizing our built-in shaders. Notably, this means you can now import and run the built-in PBR shader / lighting logic:\n#import bevy_pbr::utils\n#import bevy_pbr::clustered_forward\n#import bevy_pbr::lighting\n#import bevy_pbr::shadows\n#import bevy_pbr::pbr_types\n#import bevy_pbr::pbr_functions\n\n@fragment\nfn fragment(in: FragmentInput) -&gt; @location(0) vec4&lt;f32&gt; {\n    var pbr_input: PbrInput = pbr_input_new();\n    // set the base color to red\n    pbr_input.material.base_color = vec4&lt;f32&gt;(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);\n    /* set other PbrInput fields here */\n    return tone_mapping(pbr(pbr_input))\n}\n\nWe've also modularized our mesh and view binding shader logic. When paired with the New Material System, users can now reasonably write custom PBR materials without re-defining all of the PBR logic in their shaders. The new Array Texture Example illustrates how to define a custom PBR shader material using these new APIs:\n\nWe also plan on evolving the user experience here. Now that we've broken everything up and modularized it, we'll work on reducing the amount of boilerplate required to extend this logic (cutting down on imports, removing the need to set all PbrInput fields, etc).\nwgpu 0.13: New WGSL Shader Syntax\n#\n\nauthors: @mockersf, wgpu and naga contributors\nWe've updated to the latest and greatest wgpu version. wgpu 0.13 brings plenty of fixes and improvements, but the most visible change is the new more ergonomic WGSL \"attribute\" syntax:\nBindings now look like this:\n// wgpu 0.12 (old)\n[[group(1), binding(0)]]\nvar&lt;uniform&gt; material: Material;\n\n// wgpu 0.13 (new)\n@group(1) @binding(0)\nvar&lt;uniform&gt; material: Material;\n\nShader stage entry points and inputs now look like this:\n// wgpu 0.12 (old)\n[[stage(vertex)]]\nfn vertex([[location(0)]] position: vec3&lt;f32&gt;, [[location(1)]] normal: vec3&lt;f32&gt;) -&gt; VertexOutput {\n}\n\n// wgpu 0.13 (new)\n@vertex\nfn vertex(@location(0) position: vec3&lt;f32&gt;, @location(1) normal: vec3&lt;f32&gt;) -&gt; VertexOutput {\n}\n\nMuch easier on the eyes! (and the fingers!)\nScene Bundle\n#\n\nauthors: @mockersf\nIn previous versions of Bevy scenes were spawned like this:\ncommands.spawn_scene(asset_server.load(\"some.gltf#Scene0\"));\n\nThis worked, but it made it difficult to actually use the scene in practice. Repositioning the scene required either manually grabbing the scene's entity id and then repositioning it when it spawns, or creating a parent entity with the relevant transform components and \"spawning the scene as a child\". Additionally, it was challenging to extend scenes with new components.\nIn Bevy 0.8, we've added a SceneBundle, which brings scene spawning in line with our other entity construction APIs:\ncommands.spawn_bundle(SceneBundle {\n    scene: asset_server.load(\"some.gltf#Scene0\"),\n    ..default()\n})\n\nWhen the scene loads, it will automatically spawn underneath the entity created by the spawn_bundle command. This makes it much easier to transform the scene and add new components at the \"root\":\ncommands\n    .spawn_bundle(SceneBundle {\n        scene: asset_server.load(\"player.gltf#Scene0\"),\n        transform: Transform::from_xyz(10.0, 20.0, 30.0),\n        ..default()\n    })\n    .insert(Player::default());\n\nParallel Frustum Culling\n#\n\nauthors: @aevyrie\nBevy uses \"frustum culling\" to skip drawing entities that are outside of the camera's view. In Bevy 0.8, frustum culling is now done in parallel. When culling thousands of entities, this yields significant performance improvements:\nfrustum culling system time vs number of entities culled (lower is better)\n#\n\n\nNote that \"parallel b\" stand for \"parallel batch size\" (number of entities in each batch). We selected 1024 as our batch size in Bevy 0.8, as that performs better.\nAutomatic Mesh Tangent Generation\n#\n\nauthors: Rob Swain (@superdump), @jakobhellermann, @DJMcNab\nVertex tangents are used in tandem with normal maps to give meshes more detailed normals when rendering them. Some imported meshes have normal maps, but don't have vertex tangents calculated. Bevy can now automatically generate vertex tangents for Meshes that are missing them using the defacto industry-standard MikkTSpace library / algorithm (Godot, Unity, Unreal, and Blender all use this).\nWe have started maintaining our own fork of the gltf-rs/mikktspace crate so we can:\n\nupdate dependencies at the speed required for Bevy;\nstart reining in the unsafe code, as it currently uses unsafe Rust code auto-generated from the original mikktspace.h written in C.\n\nDefault to Linear Texture Filtering\n#\n\nauthors: @aevyrie, @cart\nImages in Bevy now use linear texture filtering by default, which is more in line with the rest of the gamedev ecosystem (Unity and Godot both default to filtered textures).\nThis means that textures that require unfiltered pixels (such as \"pixel art\" sprites) must override this default, either per-image:\nimage.sampler_descriptor = ImageSampler::nearest();\n\nor globally using the new ImageSettings resource:\napp.insert_resource(ImageSettings::default_nearest())\n\nWith that, we get crisp pixel art:\n\nNew GlobalTransform Matrix Representation\n#\n\nauthors: @HackerFoo\nThe internal representation of the GlobalTransform component (representing the \"world space\" transform for an entity) has been changed from a \"similarity\" (translation Vec3 / rotation Quat / scale Vec3) to an \"affine 3D transform\" (Mat3A and a Vec3 translation).\nNotably, this allows for shear to be represented. Shear is a controversial topic. Engine and physics programmers tend to hate it. Artists tend to love it. Given that most artist tools and game engines support shear in their equivalent types, we believe it is important to provide this as an option.\nShaderType derive\n#\n\nauthors: @teoxoy\nBevy 0.8 now uses the ShaderType trait / derive (provided by the encase crate) to easily convert Rust data types to GPU-compatible shader data types.\n// ShaderType requires each field to implement ShaderType,\n// which Bevy's math types and Color type implement.\n#[derive(ShaderType)]\nstruct SpriteData {\n    position: Vec2,\n    color: Color,\n}\n\nAnd on the WGSL shader side it looks like this:\nstruct SpriteData {\n    position: vec2&lt;f32&gt;,\n    color: vec4&lt;f32&gt;,\n};\n\n@group(1) @binding(0)\nvar&lt;uniform&gt; sprite_data: SpriteData;\n\nThis trait can be used in the new Material system if you need to define custom shader uniform or buffer bindings.\nShaderType replaces the AsStd140 and AsStd430 traits / derives (provided by the crevice crate) used in previous Bevy versions. This simplifies (and clarifies) the \"how to transfer data to the GPU\" story in Bevy, while also adding new features, such as support for unbounded Rust vecs (for storage buffers) and configurable dynamic offsets for uniform and storage buffers.\nFor example, Bevy's built-in lighting pipeline was adjusted to take advantage of this:\n#[derive(ShaderType)]\npub struct GpuPointLightsStorage {\n    #[size(runtime)]\n    data: Vec&lt;GpuPointLight&gt;,\n}\n\nRender Phase Sorting Optimization\n#\n\nauthors: @james7132, Rob Swain (@superdump)\nBevy uses \"render phases\" to collect per-entity render logic for a render pass. These phases can be sorted to control draw order for a variety of reasons: back-to-front depth sorting for transparency correctness and front-to-back sorting for early fragment discarding during opaque rendering.\nWhen possible, Bevy 0.8 now uses \"unstable sorts\" (currently \"radix sort\"), which yields a significant performance improvement:\nmany_cubes stress test \"opaque phase\" sort times (in milliseconds, less is better)\n#\n\n\nVertex Colors\n#\n\nauthors: @HackerFoo, @thebracket\nBevy's 2D and 3D pipelines and Materials now support vertex colors, if a given Mesh provides them. The PBR StandardMaterial and the 2D ColorMaterial build on this and will use the vertex colors if they are set:\n\nRegular Polygon and Circle Mesh Primitives\n#\n\nauthors: @rparrett\nBevy now has Circle and RegularPolygon Mesh shapes:\n\nlet pentagon = RegularPolygon::new(10., 5);\nlet handle = meshes.add(Mesh::from(pentagon));\ncommands.spawn_bundle(ColorMesh2dBundle {\n    mesh: handle.into(),\n    ..default()\n});\n\nScripting and Modding Progress: Untyped ECS APIs\n#\n\nauthors: @jakobhellermann\nBevy officially only supports Rust as the \"one true way to define app logic\". We have very good reasons for this and that philosophy likely won't change any time soon. But we do want to provide the tools needed for the community to build 3rd party scripting / modding plugins for their languages of choice.\nWhen we released Bevy ECS V2, we intentionally built our internal ECS storage with these cases in mind. But we didn't expose public APIs that made it possible to interact with ECS data without normal Rust types.\nBevy 0.8 adds public \"untyped\" ECS apis that enable retrieving lifetimed pointers to component and resource data using ComponentId instead of actual Rust types.\nlet health_ptr: Ptr = world.entity(player).get_by_id(heath_component_id).unwrap();\n\nThese, when combined with our reflection APIs, provide the tools needed to start building scripting support!\n@jakobhellermann has started building their own JavaScript / TypeScript plugin for Bevy. Note that:\n\nThis plugin is still very much a work in progress and is not ready to be used in projects.\nThis is an unofficial community effort. Bevy will not be adding official JavaScript/TypeScript support.\n\nHere is a TypeScript snippet from their repository that queries Bevy ECS data from the script:\nconst ballQuery = world.query({\n    components: [ballId, transformId, velocityId],\n});\nfor (const item of ballQuery) {\n    let [ball, transform, velocity] = item.components;\n    velocity = velocity[0];\n\n    info(velocity.toString());\n}\n\nQuery IntoIter\n#\n\nauthors: @TheRawMeatball\nBevy ECS Queries now implement the IntoIterator trait, which provides access to Rust's nicer iteration syntax:\n// In previous Bevy versions, iter/iter_mut had to be called manually:\nfn system(mut players: Query&lt;&amp;mut Player&gt;) {\n    for player in players.iter() {\n    }\n    \n    for mut player in players.iter_mut() {\n    }\n}\n\n// In Bevy 0.8, you have the option to use this syntax:\nfn system(mut players: Query&lt;&amp;mut Player&gt;) {\n    for player in &amp;players {\n    }\n    \n    for mut player in &amp;mut players {\n    }\n}\n\nQuery::iter_many\n#\n\nauthors: @devil-ira\nIt is now possible to pass a list of entities to a Query to iterate over using Query::iter_many, which is significantly more ergonomic than calling get(entity) on each individual entity:\n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct BlueTeam {\n    members: Vec&lt;Entity&gt;,\n}\n\nfn system(blue_team: Res&lt;BlueTeam&gt;, players: Query&lt;&amp;Player&gt;) {\n    info!(\"Blue Team Assemble!\");\n    for player in players.iter_many(&amp;blue_team.members) {\n        info!(\"{}\", player.name);\n    }    \n}\n\nThere is also a Query::iter_many_mut, which provides similar functionality for mutable queries. But to ensure aliased mutability is not allowed, it does not implement iterator. Instead, use this pattern:\nlet mut iter = players.iter_many_mut(&amp;blue_team.members);\nwhile let Some(mut player) = iter.fetch_next() {\n    player.score += 1;\n}\n\nConvert Mutable Queries to Read-only\n#\n\nauthors: @harudagondi\nMutable Queries can now be converted to their read-only versions, which makes it easier to build and use abstractions over queries:\nfn system(mut players: Query&lt;&amp;mut Player&gt;) {\n    for mut player in &amp;mut players {\n        // mutate players here\n    }\n\n    log_players(players.to_readonly());\n}\n\nfn log_players(players: Query&lt;&amp;Players&gt;) {\n    for player in &amp;players {\n        info!(\"{player:?}\");\n    }\n}\n\nECS \"lifetimed pointers\"\n#\n\nauthors: @TheRawMeatball, @BoxyUwU, @jakobhellermann\nBevy ECS has been refactored to use lifetimed, type-erased pointers instead of \"raw pointers\", which significantly improved the safety and legibility of our internals without compromising performance or flexibility.\nFrom a high level, this enables us to \"retain\" the lifetime of World borrows throughout our internals while still using type-erased APIs to support scenarios like 3rd party scripting languages.\nBy retaining this lifetime, we can rely more on Rust's borrow checker to yell at us when we are doing something unsound. And, as it happens, this caught a number of soundness bugs!\nECS Query Internals Refactors\n#\n\nauthors: @BoxyUwU\n@BoxyUwU has been hard at work refactoring our Query internals to be simpler and easier to read:\n\nReadOnlyFetch was replaced with ReadOnlyWorldQuery, moving this trait constraint \"up a level\", making it easier to express in the type system.\n\"QF Fetch generics\" were removed from Query and QueryState methods and types in favor of WorldQuery usage, making filters and normal fetches consistent in the type system and simpler to express.\n\nWe have more changes in this vein planned for the next release. Bevy ECS internals are becoming considerably easier to understand!\nECS Optimizations\n#\n\nauthors: @DJMcNab, @james7132\nBevy ECS had a number of optimizations this time around:\n\n@james7132 sped up entity moves between tables by reducing the number of copies conducted. For larger components, this is a huge win. The many_cubes stress test saw a ~16% speed boost in the prepare_uniform_components system, which relies heavily on commands / table moves.\n@DJMcNab removed no-op drop function calls for ECS storage internals, which reduced the dropping time for the many_cubes stress test from ~150μs to ~80μs.\n@james7132 changed ComponentSparseSet indices from usize to u32, which makes them use less space / making some operations more cache friendly. Sparse Set iteration became ~15% faster with this change.\n\nLabel Optimizations\n#\n\nauthors: @JoJoJet\nBevy relies on \"labels\" to identify things like systems, stages, and apps. This is useful for things like defining system dependencies. The traits SystemLabel, StageLabel, and AppLabel build on the same underlying \"typed label\" system. It enables developers to define custom labels while retaining type safety. Much better than using something like a string or an integer label!\nIn Bevy 0.8 we've optimized the internal representation of labels by removing boxing / trait objects in favor of a single cheap-to-copy-and-compare \"system label id\" type.\nThis new representation sped up schedule construction by ~30%!\ntime to prepare and compute schedule with 100 systems (in milliseconds, less is better)\n#\n\n\nThis change also removed a number of trait requirements from our label derives:\n// Old (Bevy 0.7)\n#[derive(SystemLabel, Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]\nenum MovementSystem {\n    Velocity,\n    Gravity,\n}\n\n// New (Bevy 0.8)\n#[derive(SystemLabel, Clone)]\nenum MovementSystem {\n    Velocity,\n    Gravity,\n}\n\nHierarchy Commands\n#\n\nauthors: @james7132\nBevy's entity hierarchy system is based on two components: Parent (which points to an entity's parent) and Children (which points to a list of the entity's children). This separation is important, as it makes it easy and cheap to query for \"hierarchy roots\":\nfn system(roots: Query&lt;Entity, Without&lt;Parent&gt;&gt;) { }\n\nIn past versions of Bevy, we built a complex system to \"maintain\" the integrity of the hierarchy. As Parent / Children components were added/removed/changed for an entity, we would do our best to sync everything up across the hierarchy.\nHowever this meant that for a given point in time, the hierarchy could be \"out of sync\" and incorrect.\nOur solution to this problem is to remove the deferred \"hierarchy maintenance system\" in favor of making hierarchy changes \"transactional\". Hierarchy changes are now done via transactional Commands, and directly modifying the component fields individually is no longer possible. This ensures that for a given point in time, the hierarchy is \"correct\".\nFor most Bevy developers this is a non-breaking change, as most hierarchies are already constructed using with_children commands:\ncommands\n    .spawn_bundle(SpatialBundle::default())\n    .with_children(|parent| {\n        parent.spawn_bundle(SpriteBundle {\n            texture: player_texture,\n            ..default()\n        });\n        parent.spawn_bundle(SpriteBundle {\n            texture: hat_texture,\n            ..default()\n        });\n    });\n\nHowever for logic that adds/removes child entities from parents at runtime, the following commands must be used:\n// removes the given children from the parent\ncommands.entity(some_parent).remove_children(&amp;[child1, child2]);\n// pushes the given children to the \"end\" of the parent's Children list\ncommands.entity(some_parent).push_children(&amp;[child3, child4]);\n// inserts the given children into the parent's Children list at the given index \ncommands.entity(some_parent).insert_children(1, &amp;[child5]);\n\nWe've also added HierarchyEvent, which makes it possible for developers to track changes in the hierarchy.\nThere are still a couple of small holes to close, but staying on the \"happy path\" is much easier now:\n\nremoving only one of the components is possible (although heavily discouraged)\nadding default values of only one of the components manually is still possible (although heavily discouraged)\n\nWe're discussing ways to resolve this class of problem, such as Archetype Rules / Invariants.\nBevy Reflection Improvements\n#\n\nBevy's \"Rust reflection\" system bevy_reflect is a core, foundational piece of Bevy's scene system. It provides a way to dynamically interact with Rust types at run-time without knowing their actual types. We've invested heavily in it this release to prepare for scripting support and scene system improvements.\nbevy_reflect aims to be a \"generic\" Rust reflection system. It can be used without Bevy. We believe it fills a very real gap in the Rust ecosystem and we encourage the wider Rust community to use it (and contribute!).\n\"Untyped\" Reflection\n#\n\nauthors: @jakobhellermann\nThe Reflect derives now automatically add a new ReflectFromPtr struct to the TypeRegistry for each reflected type. This enables using the new untyped ECS apis in combination with the reflection system. This helps enable things like 3rd party scripting and modding.\nDefault Trait Reflection\n#\n\nauthors: @jakobhellermann\nIt is now possible to construct Reflect types using their Default trait impl, provided they register it as part of the Reflect derive:\n#[derive(Reflect, Default)]\n#[reflect(Default)]\nstruct MyStruct {\n    foo: String,\n    bar: usize,\n}\n\nlet registration = type_registry.get(TypeId::of::&lt;MyStruct&gt;()).unwrap();\nlet reflect_default = registration.data::&lt;ReflectDefault&gt;().unwrap();\n// This contains a MyStruct instance with default values\nlet my_struct: Box&lt;dyn Reflect&gt; = reflect_default.default();\n\nThis enables constructing components for entities without any compile time information, which is useful for dynamic scenarios like scripting and scenes.\nArray Reflection\n#\n\nauthors: @NathanSWard, @MrGVSV\nBevy's reflection system now supports reflecting Rust arrays, which can be interacted with in a type-erased manner using the new Array trait.\n#[derive(Reflect)]\nstruct Sprite {\n    position: [f32; 2],\n}\n\nlet sprite = Sprite {\n    position: [0.1, 0.2],\n};\n\nlet position = sprite.field(\"position\").unwrap();\nif let ReflectRef::Array(array) = position.reflect_ref() {\n    let x = array.get(0).unwrap();\n    assert_eq!(x.downcast_ref::&lt;f32&gt;(), Some(&amp;0.1));\n}\n\nStatic TypeInfo\n#\n\nauthors: @MrGVSV\nThe Reflect trait provides dynamic access to a specific instance of a type, but some scenarios (such as deserializing) benefit from knowing type information before we have an instance of a type. This opens the doors to building a Reflect-based serde alternative (or at the very least, a serde-less Bevy Scene deserializer).\nBevy 0.8 adds the ability to retrieve TypeInfo for any type implementing Reflect:\n#[derive(Reflect)]\nstruct Foo {\n    a: f32,\n    b: usize,\n}\n\nlet info = Foo::type_info();\nif let TypeInfo::Struct(info) = info {\n  assert!(info.is::&lt;Foo&gt;());\n  assert_eq!(info.type_name(), std::any::type_name::&lt;Foo&gt;(),);\n  assert!(info.field(\"a\").unwrap().is::&lt;f32&gt;());\n  assert!(info.field_at(1).unwrap().is::&lt;usize&gt;());\n}\n\nNote that type_info() returns &amp;'static TypeInfo: it will lazily allocate and store TypeInfo the first time it is requested, then reuse that on each subsequent request.\nGeneric types also support TypeInfo:\n#[derive(Reflect)]\nstruct Foo&lt;T&gt; {\n    value: T\n}\n\nlet info = Foo::&lt;f32&gt;::type_info();\nif let TypeInfo::Struct(info) = info {\n  assert!(info.field(\"value\").unwrap().is::&lt;f32&gt;());\n}\n\nResource Reflection\n#\n\nauthors: @Shatur\nBevy ECS resources can now be reflected:\n#[derive(Reflect)]\n#[reflect(Resource)]\nstruct Scoreboard {\n    points: usize,\n}\n\nThis registers a ReflectResource in the TypeRegistry entry for the type, enabling type-erased read/write operations for the resource in an ECS World.\nPretty Reflect Debug Formatting\n#\n\nauthors: @MrGVSV\n\"Debug printing\" Reflect references now provides pretty / useful outputs.\nConsider the following example:\n#[derive(Reflect)]\nstruct Foo {\n    a: f32,\n    b: Bar,\n}\n\n#[derive(Reflect)]\nstruct Bar {\n    x: String,\n    y: usize,\n}\nlet foo = Foo {\n    a: 42.0,\n    b: Bar {\n        x: \"hello\".to_string(),\n        y: 123,\n    },\n};\n\nlet foo_reflect: &amp;dyn Reflect = &amp;foo;\nprintln!(\"{:#?}\", foo_reflect);\n\nIn previous versions of Bevy, this would have printed:\nReflect(my_crate::Foo)\n\nIn Bevy 0.8, it prints:\nmy_crate::Foo {\n    a: 42.0,\n    b: my_crate::Bar {\n        x: \"hello\",\n        y: 123,\n    },\n}\n\nMuch better!\nbevy_reflect Internal Refactors\n#\n\nauthors: @MrGVSV, @PROMETHIA-27, @jakobhellermann\nNow that bevy_reflect is starting to get some serious investment and usage, we've invested time in reworking the internals to make them easier to maintain and extend:\n\nReflect Derive Reorganization: the derive logic was broken up into smaller, more maintainable pieces. \"Metadata structs\" were added to collect and organize derive inputs. (@MrGVSV)\nThe Reflect trait is now safe to implement: Soundness no longer hinges on the implementor doing the right thing, thanks to some changes to the Reflect interface. As a result, we were able to remove the unsafe keyword from the Reflect trait. (@PROMETHIA-27)\nSerialize logic is now implemented using TypeRegistry type data like other reflected trait logic, rather than being hard-coded into Reflect impls. (@jakobhellermann)\n\nRender World Extract\n#\n\nauthors: @DJMcNab, @cart\nNote: The renderer APIs discussed here are for developers of advanced custom rendering features and core Bevy renderer developers. If this seems verbose or the intent is confusing, don't worry!\nBevy's new renderer \"extracts\" data needed for rendering from the \"main\" Bevy app, which enables parallel pipelined rendering. To facilitate this, in previous versions of Bevy we made the ECS RenderStage::Extract \"special\" (and more than a little bit weird). Systems in that stage ran on the \"main\" app world, but applied the system Commands to the \"render\" app world.\nThis accomplished the goal, but it:\n\nWas confusing: render feature developers had to \"know\" that this stage behaved differently from the other \"normal\" ECS stages in the schedule. Implicitly, Commands behaved differently and the ECS data access was \"flipped\". Using \"normal\" entity spawning apis would not work as expected because the Commands parameter internally still used the main app's Entities collection.\nPrevented parallelism: directly modifying existing \"render world\" resources required exclusive access to ResMut&lt;RenderWorld&gt;, which prevented these systems from running in parallel. Making this access parallel required unnecessary allocations using Commands, which for \"large\" (or incrementally updated) extractions was inefficient.\n\n// Old: Bevy 0.7 (limited parallelism)\nfn extract_score(score: Res&lt;Score&gt;, mut render_world: ResMut&lt;RenderWorld&gt;) {\n    *render_world.resource_mut::&lt;ExtractedScore&gt;() = ExtractedScore::from(score);\n}\n\n// Old: Bevy 0.7 (unnecessary allocations / prevents incremental updates)\nfn extract_score(mut commands: Commands, score: Res&lt;Score&gt;) {\n    commands.insert_resource(ExtractedScore::from(&amp;score));\n}\n\nIn Bevy 0.8, we've made the extract stage \"normal\". It runs directly on the \"render world\", just like the other render app stages. To \"extract\" data from the main app world, just wrap the relevant system parameters in the new Extract type to retrieve that parameter from the main app world instead:\n// New: Bevy 0.8 (parallel and not weird!)\nfn extract_score(mut extracted_score: ResMut&lt;ExtractedScore&gt;, score: Extract&lt;Res&lt;Score&gt;&gt;) {\n    *extracted_score = ExtractedScore::from(&amp;score);\n}\n\nThe extract system is now parallel, the data access is consistent with other renderer ECS stages, and the intent of the system is clearer.\nExtractResource Trait and Plugin\n#\n\nauthors: Rob Swain (@superdump)\nSome ECS resources have very simple extract logic:\nfn extract_cool_color(mut extracted_cool_color: ResMut&lt;CoolColor&gt;, cool_color: Extract&lt;Res&lt;CoolColor&gt;&gt;) {\n    *extracted_cool_color = cool_color.clone();\n}\n\nRather than force developers to write this out manually, Bevy 0.8 now provides the ExtractResource trait / derive:\n#[derive(ExtractResource, Clone)]\nstruct CoolColor {\n    color: Color,\n}\n\nThen, just add the ExtractResourcePlugin&lt;CoolColor&gt; to your App and the resource will be automatically extracted.\nExtractResource can also be implemented manually if you need custom logic (or the type needs to change):\nimpl ExtactResource for ExtractedCoolColor {\n    type Source = CoolColor;\n    fn extract_resource(source: &amp;CoolColor) -&gt; Self {\n        Self {\n            color: source.color.as_rgba_linear(),\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nTaffy migration: a refreshed UI layout library\n#\n\nauthors: @alice-i-cecile, @jkelleyrtp, @Weibye, @TimJentzsch, @colepoirier\nBevy's moved off the abandoned stretch UI layout crate and onto its new community-maintained hard fork: taffy. Together with the Dioxus team, we've dramatically cleaned up the code base, solved a critical performance issue with deep UI trees and freshened up the docs.\nWe're looking forward to its continued maintenance and development as the team continues to improve its performance, fix bugs, and add support for alternative layout paradigms.\nECS Soundness / Correctness Improvements\n#\n\nauthors: @TheRawMeatball, @BoxyUwU, @SkiFire13, @jakobhellermann\nBevy ECS received a solid number of soundness and correctness bug fixes this release:\n\nRemoved EntityMut::get_unchecked: The only way to soundly use this API is already encapsulated within EntityMut::get. Therefore there was no reason to keep this unsafe API around.\nFixed unsoundness with some Or/AnyOf/Option component access: Previous Bevy versions allowed unsound versions of these queries. We now properly prevent those uses.\nImprove soundness of CommandQueue: It is now sound to store Commands with padding or uninitialized bytes. A \"use after move\" case was also removed.\nFix some memory leaks detected by Miri: Miri detected a case that leaks in our BlobVec drop impl. That is now fixed.\nLint for missing SAFETY comments in bevy_ecs: We now require safety comments for unsafe code blocks in bevy_ecs.\n\nAs Bevy ECS matures, our bar for unsafe code blocks and soundness must also mature. Bevy ECS will probably never be 100% free of unsafe code blocks because we are modeling parallel data access that Rust cannot reason about without our help. But we are committed to both removing as much unsafe code as we can and improving the quality of the unsafe code that remains.\nAndroid Progress: We aren't there yet, but we're closer!\n#\n\nauthors: @mockersf\nBevy now \"kind of\" runs on Android again!\nHowever Android support is not ready yet. There are issues with how we manage render contexts that must be resolved that sometimes break rendering at startup and always break rendering when apps are minimized. Audio also doesn't work yet.\nHere is the load_gltf Bevy example running on my Pixel 6:\n\nThat being said, this is an important step forward, as Bevy developers can now build, deploy, (and in some cases test) Bevy apps on Android!\nIf you are itching to test Bevy on mobile platforms, our iOS support is much more polished. Bevy developers have already started publishing Bevy-based iOS apps to the Apple App Store!\nCI / Build System Improvements\n#\n\nauthors: @mockersf, @NiklasEi\nAs always, Bevy's CI had plenty of improvements this cycle:\n\nExamples are now run in WASM when validating builds. Screenshots are taken and stored as part of the build outputs to ensure rendering works (@mockersf).\nThe Bevy examples are now run on a Windows VM once per day to ensure they aren't broken (@mockersf).\nLicense files are now automatically added to all published crates (@NiklasEi).\nThere is now a workflow to automatically generate a PR with version number bumps for all Bevy crates (@mockersf).\nTo make the occasional nightly Rust breakage less disruptive, we've parameterized the nightly toolchain to make it easier to pin to a specific nightly. (@mockersf)\n\nExample: Post Processing\n#\n\nauthors: @Vrixyz\nWe've added a new example that shows how to use the new Camera Driven Rendering and Shader Materials to build a \"chromatic aberration\" post processing effects using a full screen quad and \"render to texture\".\n\nWe plan on building more formal post processing APIs in future releases, but this approach is relatively straightforward and opens up a lot of doors. Much simpler than extending the lower level RenderGraph!\nRun it by cloning the Bevy repo and running cargo run --release --example post_processing.\nExample: Many Animated Foxes\n#\n\nauthors: @superdump\nThis is a fun stress test of our Skeletal Animation System that renders many animated foxes walking around in a circle.\n\nRun it by cloning the Bevy repo and running cargo run --release --example many_foxes.\nWASM Example Build Tool\n#\n\nauthors: @mockersf\nWe've built a tool to make it easier to build and run Bevy's examples in your browser:\nIn the root of the Bevy repo, run the following command:\ncargo run -p build-wasm-example -- lighting\n\nThis will run the cargo build and wasm-bindgen commands, and place the output in the examples/wasm folder. Run your favorite \"local webserver\" command there, such as python3 -m http.server and open that url in your browser!\nWebsite: Improved Examples Page\n#\n\nauthors: @doup, @ickk\nThe Bevy WASM Examples pages have been reworked:\n\nThey now display loading bars while Bevy App content and assets load\nThe design / layout of the page is now much nicer\n\n\nBevy Org Changes\n#\n\nAs Bevy grows, we are constantly re-evaluating our development process to accommodate an ever-increasing volume of development. We're long past the point where I can make every decision and I've been slowly delegating responsibilities as my trust in the knowledge and experience of our community members grows.\nThis release cycle, there were two major changes to the Bevy Org:\n\nAll existing developers with \"delegated merge rights\" (@mockersf and @alice-i-cecile) now have the title \"maintainer\".\nRob Swain (@superdump) is now a maintainer. You will probably recognize them from their work on Bevy's renderer. They've been a veritable force of nature, driving forward clustered forward rendering, directional and point light shadows, visibility / frustum culling, alpha blending, compressed GPU textures, and more. Rob has demonstrated deep understanding of rendering algorithms, Bevy internals, and Bevy project direction. I'm certainly looking forward to what they build next!\n\nBeing a \"maintainer\" now works like this:\n\nMaintainers now have no (hard) limits on the \"area\" of PRs they can merge. No more limits on \"docs only\", \"rendering only\", etc. It is now each maintainers' responsibility to evaluate their areas of comfort. This does increase risk to an extent, but I think it's an important step to allow maintainers to grow organically.\nMaintainers can merge \"relatively uncontroversial\" PRs with at least two community approvals. Maintainers will collectively decide and enforce what is uncontroversial. Controversial PRs should be labeled with the S-Controversial label. Note that \"two community approvals\" is the minimum requirement. Maintainers are responsible for ensuring the appropriate people have approved a PR.\nMaintainers can merge \"completely trivial\" PRs without two community approvals. Some examples of \"completely trivial\": typo fixes, removing unused dependencies or code, and small \"api consistency\" fixes.\nControversial Decision Making on a Timer: For all controversial PRs (including RFCs), if two maintainers approve, the PR can be labeled with a S-Ready-For-Final-Review label. As soon as this label is added and I have been pinged, a clock starts. If I have not responded with actionable feedback, a \"snooze button\" / \"we aren't ready for this yet\", or a veto within a month and a half (45 days), maintainers are free to merge the PR. This gives me the ability to dictate project direction in areas where that is important while also empowering maintainers to move things forward in parallel when that makes sense. We will be calibrating this approach as we go to make sure we strike the right balance between progress, quality, and consistent vision.\nI still reserve the right to veto all code changes and make unilateral code changes. This includes reverting \"controversial changes\" merged via (4).\n\nWe've used this process for most of the last cycle and I'm loving how it is working so far: more trust, more eyes on each decision, faster development velocity, no more trivial fixes sitting in limbo. I still get to enforce consistent vision when that matters, but the community is empowered to drive efforts forward.\nWhat's Next?\n#\n\n\nPost Processing: We have a lot of post processing work in the pipeline (some of it almost made it in to this release). The next release will make it easier to write post processing effects (thanks to intermediate HDR textures and a separate tonemapping step), and it will also include built-in effects like bloom and upscaling.\nAsset Preprocessing: We will be investing heavily in our asset pipeline, with a focus on:\n\nPre-processing assets to do expensive work \"during development time\", so Bevy Apps can be deployed with assets that are prettier, smaller, and/or faster to load.\nEnabling configuring assets with .meta files. For example, you could define a texture compression level, the filter it should use, or the target format.\n\n\nScene System Improvements: This release saw a lot of investment in Reflection. We can now build the next iteration of the scene system on top of it, with a nicer scene format, nested scenes, and improved workflows.\nBevy UI Improvements: In preparation for the visual Bevy Editor, we will be improving the capabilities and user experince of Bevy UI.\nBevy Jam #2: Bevy Jam #1 was a massive success: 74 entries, 1,618 ratings, and lots of good community vibes. Now that Bevy 0.8 is released, it's time to jam again! We'll release details on this soon.

0.8"},"https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-9/":{"body":"Thanks to 159 contributors, 430 pull requests, community reviewers, and our generous sponsors, I'm happy to announce the Bevy 0.9 release on crates.io!\nFor those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. You can check out our Quick Start Guide to try it today. It's free and open source forever! You can grab the full source code on GitHub. Check out Bevy Assets for a collection of community-developed plugins, games, and learning resources.\nTo update an existing Bevy App or Plugin to Bevy 0.9, check out our 0.8 to 0.9 Migration Guide.\nSince our last release a few months ago we've added a ton of new features, bug fixes, and quality of life tweaks, but here are some of the highlights:\n\n\nHDR Post Processing, Tonemapping, and Bloom: Bevy has a new HDR post processing and tonemapping pipeline, which we used to implement the \"bloom\" post processing effect!\nFXAA: Fast approximate anti-aliasing was added, which gives users a new cheap option for screen space anti-aliasing.\nDeband Dithering: Hide gradient precision errors with this new post processing effect!\nOther Post Processing Improvements: View target double buffering and automatic render target format handling.\nNew Scene Format: Bevy's new scene format is smaller, simpler to compose manually, and easier to read. Comes in both \"human readable\" and \"binary\" variants!\nCode Driven Scene Construction: Build scenes dynamically from an existing app using queries and specific entity references.\nImproved Entity/Component APIs: Spawning entities with components is now simpler and more ergonomic than ever!\nExclusive System Rework: Exclusive systems (systems with unique ECS World access) are now just \"normal\" systems with significantly improved usability.\nEnum Reflection: Bevy Reflect can now reflect enum types, which exposes them to Bevy's scene system and opens doors to editor tooling for enums.\nTime Shader Globals: Time is now passed to shaders as a global, making time-driven animation in custom shaders easy!\nPlugin Settings: Plugins can now have settings, which can be overridden in plugin groups, simplifying the plugin configuration story.\nBevy UI Z-Indices: Control how UI elements stack on top of each other using local and global z-indices\n\nHDR Post Processing, Tonemapping, and Bloom\n#\n\nauthors: @ChangeCaps, @jakobhellermann, @cart, @JMS55\nBevy now supports the \"bloom\" post processing effect, backed by a ton of internal improvements to our HDR (High Dynamic Range) render pipeline.\n\nBloom creates a \"blurred\" effect around bright lights, which emulates how cameras (and our eyes) often perceive light in the real world. High quality bloom builds on top of HDR render pipelines, which represents light and color using more than the standard 8 bits per channel (rgba) used elsewhere. In previous releases Bevy already did HDR lighting internally in its PBR shader, but because we were rendering to a \"normal\" (low dynamic range) texture, we had to lose the extra high dynamic range information when we mapped the HDR lighting to the LDR texture (using a process called tonemapping).\nIn Bevy 0.9, you can now configure cameras to render to HDR textures, which will preserve the high dynamic range information after the \"main pass\" is finished rendering:\nCamera {\n    // Currently this defaults to false, but we will likely\n    // switch this to true by default in future releases\n    hdr: true,\n    ..default()\n}\n\nThis enables post processing effects, such as bloom, to have access to the raw HDR information. When HDR textures are enabled, we delay \"tonemapping\" until after \"HDR post processing effects\" have run in our Render Graph.\nBloom is enabled by adding a BloomSettings component to a camera with HDR textures enabled:\ncommands.spawn((\n    Camera3dBundle {\n        camera: Camera {\n            hdr: true,\n            ..default()\n        },\n        ..default()\n    },\n    BloomSettings::default(),\n));\n\nThe bloom effect can be overbearing if misconfigured. BloomSettings has a number of options to tune it, but the most relevant is intensity, which can (and should) be used to adjust how much the effect is applied.\nSeriously ... this effect can be obnoxious:\n\nIn most cases, it is best to err on the side of subtlety.\nHDR rendering is also available in 2D, which means you can also use bloom effects in 2D!\n\nFXAA: Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing\n#\n\nauthors: @DGriffin91, @cart\nBevy 0.9 adds support for FXAA (fast approximate anti-aliasing). FXAA is a popular (and cheap!) anti-aliasing approach that uses luminance data contrast to identify edges and blur them:\n\n\nBevy already has support for MSAA (multisample anti-aliasing), which does multiple samples when rendering geometry edges, which makes those edges crisper:\n\nPicking an anti-aliasing implementation is all about tradeoffs:\n\nMSAA: Crisp, high quality geometry edges. Leaves other parts of the image (such as textures and shadows) untouched, which can be a pro (crisper outputs) or a con (more aliasing). More expensive than FXAA.\nFXAA: Considers the entire image when blurring, including textures, which can be a pro (textures and shadows get anti-aliased) or a con (the image gets blurrier as a whole). Cheap to run (a good choice for mobile or web AA).\n\nNow that our post processing pipeline is maturing, we plan on adding even more anti-aliasing options in future Bevy releases. We already have TAA (temporal anti-aliasing) and SMAA (subpixel morphological anti-aliasing) implementations in the works!\nDeband Dithering\n#\n\nauthors: @aevyrie\n\"Color banding\" is a known limitation when using 8 bit color channels (which are required by pretty much every device / screen).\nThis is most visible when trying to render smooth gradients for low noise textures (ex: the lighting on a \"pure green\" material):\n\nIf you look closely at the green plane or the tan cube, you will notice distinct bands for each shade of color. A popular solution to this problem is to \"dither\" the final image.\nBevy 0.9 now performs \"deband dithering\" by default in the tonemapping stage:\n\nYou can enable and disable this per-camera:\n  commands.spawn(Camera3dBundle {\n      tonemapping: Tonemapping::Enabled {\n          deband_dither: true,\n      },\n      ..default()\n  });\n\nPost Processing: View Target Double Buffering\n#\n\nauthors: @cart\nRendering post processing effects requires both an input texture (containing the \"current\" render) and an output texture (the \"new\" render with the effect applied). Previous versions of Bevy only had one main \"view target\" image. This meant that naively, post processing effects would need to manage and render to their own \"intermediate\" texture, then write it back to the main target. This is clearly inefficient, as we have a new texture allocation for each effect and we have the extra work of copying the intermediate texture back to the main texture.\nTo solve this, in Bevy 0.9 we now \"double buffer\" our view target textures, which means we have two copies of them that we flip between. At a given moment in time, one is the current \"main\" texture and the other is the \"next\" main texture. Post processing effect developers can now trigger a \"post process write\", which returns a source and destination texture. It assumes that an effect will write source to destination (with or without modifications). destination will then become the new \"main\" texture.\nlet post_process = view_target.post_process_write();\nrender_some_effect(render_context, post_process.source, post_process.destination);\n\nThis reduces the complexity burden on post processing effect developers and keeps our pipeline nice and efficient. The new FXAA effect was implemented using this new system. Post processing plugin developers can use that implementation as a reference.\nImproved Render Target Texture Format Handling\n#\n\nauthors: @VitalyAnkh, @cart\nBevy 0.9 now detects and uses each window's / surface's preferred TextureFormat, rather than using hard-coded compile-time-selected per-platform formats. This means that we automatically support uncommon platforms and configurations. Additionally, Bevy's main passes and post processing passes now render to stable / consistent TextureFormats (ex: Rgba16Float for HDR). We do a final blit from these \"standard\" textures to the final render target's preferred format. This simplifies render pipeline construction, allows for render pipeline re-use across render targets (even if their formats don't match), and provides consistent and predictable render pipeline behaviors.\nThis also means that when rendering to a texture, the texture format no longer needs to match the surface's texture format. For example, you can now render to a texture that only has a red channel:\n\nNew Scene Format\n#\n\nauthors: @MrGVSV\nBevy 0.9 introduces a much improved scene format, which makes scenes smaller, simpler to compose manually, and easier to read. This is backed by a ton of improvements to Bevy Reflect (Bevy's Rust runtime reflection system). Most of the improvements to the Bevy Scene Format are actually generic improvements to all Bevy Reflect serialization!\n// The New Bevy Scene Format\n(\n  entities: {\n    0: (\n      components: {\n        \"game::Player\": (\n          name: \"Reyna\",\n          position: (\n            x: 0.0,\n            y: 0.0,\n          ),\n        ),\n        \"game::Health\": (\n          current: 5,\n          max: 10,\n        ),\n        \"game::Team\": A,\n      },\n    ),\n    1: (\n      components: {\n        \"game::Player\": (\n          name: \"Sova\",\n          position: (\n            x: 10.0,\n            y: 0.0,\n          ),\n        ),\n        \"game::Health\": (\n          current: 10,\n          max: 10,\n        ),\n        \"game::Team\": B,\n      },\n    ),\n  },\n)\n\nCompare that to the old format:\n// The Old Bevy Scene Format\n[\n  (\n    entity: 0,\n    components: [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"game::Player\",\n        \"struct\": {\n          \"name\": {\n            \"type\": \"alloc::string::String\",\n            \"value\": \"Reyna\",\n          },\n          \"position\": {\n            \"type\": \"glam::f32::vec2::Vec2\",\n            \"struct\": {\n              \"x\": {\n                \"type\": \"f32\",\n                \"value\": 0.0,\n              },\n              \"y\": {\n                \"type\": \"f32\",\n                \"value\": 0.0,\n              },\n            },\n          },\n        },\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"game::Health\",\n        \"struct\": {\n          \"current\": {\n            \"type\": \"usize\",\n            \"value\": 5,\n          },\n          \"max\": {\n            \"type\": \"usize\",\n            \"value\": 10,\n          },\n        },\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"game::Team\",\n        \"value\": A,\n      },\n    ],\n  ),\n  (\n    entity: 1,\n    components: [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"game::Player\",\n        \"struct\": {\n          \"name\": {\n            \"type\": \"alloc::string::String\",\n            \"value\": \"Sova\",\n          },\n          \"position\": {\n            \"type\": \"glam::f32::vec2::Vec2\",\n            \"struct\": {\n              \"x\": {\n                \"type\": \"f32\",\n                \"value\": 10.0,\n              },\n              \"y\": {\n                \"type\": \"f32\",\n                \"value\": 0.0,\n              },\n            },\n          },\n        },\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"game::Health\",\n        \"struct\": {\n          \"current\": {\n            \"type\": \"usize\",\n            \"value\": 10,\n          },\n          \"max\": {\n            \"type\": \"usize\",\n            \"value\": 10,\n          },\n        },\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"game::Team\",\n        \"value\": B,\n      },\n    ],\n  ),\n]\n\nThere are so many improvements that it might be hard to pick them all out!\nSimpler Struct Syntax\n#\n\nStructs now use struct-style formatting instead of complicated map-based representations.\n// Old\n{\n    \"type\": \"game::Health\",\n    \"struct\": {\n        \"current\": {\n            \"type\": \"usize\",\n            \"value\": 5,\n        },\n        \"max\": {\n            \"type\": \"usize\",\n            \"value\": 10,\n        },\n    },\n},\n\n// New\n\"game::Health\": (\n    current: 5,\n    max: 10,\n),\n\nSimpler Primitive Serialization\n#\n\nTypes can now opt in to direct serde serialization, which makes primitive values much nicer to work with:\n// Old\n\"name\": {\n    \"type\": \"alloc::string::String\",\n    \"value\": \"Reyna\",\n},\n\n// New\nname: \"Reyna\",\n\nNicer Enum Syntax\n#\n\nConsider the enum:\npub enum Team {\n    A,\n    B,\n}\n\nLets compare how it is serialized:\n// Old\n{\n    \"type\": \"game::Team\",\n    \"value\": A,\n},\n\n// New\n\"game::Team\": A,\n\nAlso note that Bevy Reflect didn't even directly support enums until Bevy 0.9. Older versions of Bevy required using #[reflect_value] in combination with normal serde for enums, which was much more complicated. See the Enum Reflection section of this blog post for details!\nNicer Tuples\n#\n\n// Old\n{\n  \"type\": \"(f32, f32)\",\n  \"tuple\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"f32\",\n      \"value\": 1.0\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"f32\",\n      \"value\": 2.0\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n// New\n{\n  \"(f32, f32)\": (1.0, 2.0)\n}\n\nTop Level Struct\n#\n\nBevy Scenes now have a top level struct, which allows us to add additional values and metadata to the Bevy Scene format in the future (such as version numbers, ECS Resources, assets, etc).\n// Old\n[\n    /* entities here */\n]\n\n// New\n(\n    entities: (\n        /* entities here */\n    )\n)\n\nUse Maps Where Appropriate\n#\n\nEntity IDs and Component values must be unique in Bevy ECS. To better represent that, we now use map syntax instead of a list.\n// Old\n[\n  (\n    entity: 0,\n    components: [ ],\n  ),\n  (\n    entity: 1,\n    components: [ ],\n  ),\n]\n\n// New\n(\n  entities: {\n    0: (\n      components: { },\n    ),\n    1: (\n      components: { },\n    ),\n  },\n)\n\nBinary Scene Formats\n#\n\nauthors: @MrGVSV\nBevy Scenes can be serialized and deserialized to/from binary formats, such as bincode, postcard, and rmp_serde. This required adding support for \"non-self-describing\" formats to the new scene format.\nIn the case of postcard, this can be almost 5x smaller (4.53x for the scene above)! Very useful if you are trying to keep the size of the scene small on disk, or send the scene over the network.\nDynamic Scene Builder\n#\n\nauthors: @mockersf\nBevy Scenes can now be constructed dynamically using the new DynamicSceneBuilder. Previous versions of Bevy already supported writing \"whole worlds\" to scenes, but in some cases, users might only want to write specific entities to a scene. Bevy 0.9's DynamicSceneBuilder makes this possible:\n// Write players to a scene\nfn system(world: &amp;World, players: Query&lt;Entity, With&lt;Player&gt;&gt;) {\n  let builder = DynamicSceneBuilder::from_world(world);\n  builder.extract_entities(players.iter());\n  let dynamic_scene = builder.build();\n}\n\nextract_entities accepts any Entity iterator.\nYou can also pass in specific entities:\nbuilder.extract_entity(entity);\n\nMore Scene Construction Tools\n#\n\nauthors: @mockersf\nScenes can now be cloned:\nlet scene = scene.clone_with(type_registry).unwrap();\n\nDynamicScenes can now be converted to Scenes:\nlet scene = Scene::from_dynamic_scene(dynamic_scene, type_registry).unwrap();\n\nImproved Entity / Component APIs\n#\n\nauthors: @DJMcNab, @cart\nSpawning entities with components and adding / removing them from entities just got even easier!\nFirst some quick fundamentals: Bevy ECS uses Components to add data and logic to entities. To make entity composition easier, Bevy ECS also has Bundles, which define groups of components to be added together.\nJust like in previous versions of Bevy, Bundles can be tuples of components:\n(Player { name: \"Sova\" }, Health::new(10), Team::A)\n\nThe Bundle trait can also be derived:\n#[derive(Bundle)]\nstruct PlayerBundle {\n  player: Player,\n  health: Health,\n  team: Team,\n}\n\nIn Bevy 0.9, Component types now also automatically implement the Bundle trait, which allows us to consolidate all entity component operations under new spawn, insert, and remove apis. Previously, we had separate variants for Bundle (ex: insert_bundle(SomeBundle)) and Component (ex: .insert(SomeComponent)).\nThe Bundle trait is now also implemented for tuples of Bundles instead of just tuples of Components. The value of this will be made clear in a moment.\nFirst, spawn now takes a bundle:\n// Old (variant 1)\ncommands.spawn().insert_bundle(SpriteBundle::default());\n\n// Old (variant 2)\ncommands.spawn_bundle(SpriteBundle::default());\n\n// New\ncommands.spawn(SpriteBundle::default());\n\nAlready we've saved some characters, but we're just getting started! Because Component implements Bundle, we can now also pass in single components into spawn:\n// Old\ncommands.spawn().insert(Player { name: \"Sova\" });\n\n// New\ncommands.spawn(Player { name: \"Sova\" });\n\nThings get even more interesting when we introduce Bundle tuples into the mix, which allow us to combine many operations (covering both components and bundles) into a single spawn call:\n// Old\ncommands\n  .spawn_bundle(PlayerBundle::default())\n  .insert_bundle(TransformBundle::default())\n  .insert(ActivePlayer);\n\n// New\ncommands.spawn((\n  PlayerBundle::default(),\n  TransformBundle::default(),\n  ActivePlayer,\n));\n\nThis is much easier to type and read. And on top of that, from the perspective of Bevy ECS this is a single \"bundle spawn\" instead of multiple operations, which cuts down on \"archetype moves\". This makes this single spawn operation much more efficient!\nThese principles apply to the insert apis as well:\n// Old\ncommands\n  .insert_bundle(PlayerBundle::default())\n  .insert(ActivePlayer);\n\n// New\ncommands.insert((PlayerBundle::default(), ActivePlayer));\n\nThey also apply to the remove apis:\n// Old\ncommands\n  .remove_bundle::&lt;PlayerBundle&gt;()\n  .remove::&lt;ActivePlayer&gt;();\n\n// New\ncommands.remove::&lt;(PlayerBundle, ActivePlayer)&gt;();\n\nExclusive System Rework\n#\n\nauthors: @cart, @maniwani\nIn preparation for the larger scheduler changes outlined in the newly-merged (but not yet implemented) Stageless RFC, we've started blurring the lines between \"exclusive systems\" (systems with \"exclusive\" full mutable access to the ECS World) and normal systems, which historically have been separate types with strict lines between them.\nIn Bevy 0.9, exclusive systems now implement the normal System trait! This will ultimately have even larger implications, but in Bevy 0.9 this means that you no longer need to call .exclusive_system() when adding exclusive systems to your schedule:\nfn some_exclusive_system(world: &amp;mut World) { }\n\n// Old\napp.add_system(some_exclusive_system.exclusive_system())\n\n// New\napp.add_system(some_exclusive_system)\n\nWe've also expanded exclusive systems to support more system parameters, which vastly improves the user experience of writing exclusive systems and makes them more efficient by caching state across executions.\nSystemState enables using \"normal\" system parameters from inside an exclusive system:\n// Old\nfn some_system(world: &amp;mut World) {\n  let mut state: SystemState&lt;(Res&lt;Time&gt;, Query&lt;&amp;mut Transform&gt;)&gt; =\n      SystemState::new(&amp;mut world);\n  let (time, mut transforms) = state.get_mut(world);\n}\n\n// New\nfn some_system(world: &amp;mut World, state: &amp;mut SystemState&lt;(Res&lt;Time&gt;, Query&lt;&amp;mut Transform&gt;)&gt;) {\n  let (time, mut transforms) = state.get_mut(world);\n}\n\nQueryState enables cached access to individual queries:\n// Old\nfn some_system(world: &amp;mut World) {\n  let mut transforms = world.query::&lt;&amp;Transform&gt;();\n  for transform in transforms.iter(world) {\n  }\n}\n\n// New\nfn some_system(world: &amp;mut World, transforms: &amp;mut QueryState&lt;&amp;Transform&gt;) {\n  for transform in transforms.iter(world) {\n  }\n}\n\nLocal enables storing local data inside of the exclusive system:\n// Old\n#[derive(Resource)]\nstruct Counter(usize);\nfn some_system(world: &amp;mut World) {\n  let mut counter = world.resource_mut::&lt;Counter&gt;();\n  counter.0 += 1;\n}\n\n// New\nfn some_system(world: &amp;mut World, mut counter: Local&lt;usize&gt;) {\n  *counter += 1;\n}\n\nBevy ECS Now Uses GATS!\n#\n\nauthors: @BoxyUwU\nRust 1.65.0 stabilized GATs (Generic Associated Types), which enabled us to significantly simplify Bevy ECS Query internals.\nFor awhile now, Bevy ECS has been hacking around the lack of GATs with a complicated nest of traits (WorldQuery, WorldQueryGats (a \"lack of real GATs hack\" trait), and Fetch).\nIn Bevy 0.9, we now have a single WorldQuery trait! This makes Bevy ECS much easier to maintain, extend, debug, document, and understand.\nDerive Resource\n#\n\nauthors: @devil-ira, @alice-i-cecile\nThe Resource trait is now no longer automatically implemented for all types. It must be derived:\n#[derive(Resource)]\nstruct Counter(usize);\n\nThis change was made on the tail of making the same decision for Component types. In short:\n\n\nAuto-implementing Resource for every type made it very easy to accidentally insert the \"wrong\" value, such as inserting the constructor function pointer instead of the value itself:\nstruct Counter(usize);\n// This inserts the constructor function pointer as a resource!\n// Weird and confusing!\napp.insert_resource(Counter);\n// This is how it should be done!\napp.insert_resource(Counter(0));\n\n\n\nDeriving Resource documents intent in a structured way. Without a derive, resource-ness is implicit by default.\n\n\nAuto-implementing meant that plugins could use the same \"common\" type in conflicting ways (ex: std types like Vec&lt;usize&gt;). Not implementing by default means that plugins cannot use these common types in conflicting ways. They must create new types.\n\n\nThis opens the door to configuring resource types using the Rust type system (like we already do for components).\n\n\nSystem Ambiguity Resolution API Improvements\n#\n\nauthors: @JoJoJet, @alice-i-cecile\nBevy ECS schedules systems to run in parallel by default. It will safely schedule systems in parallel, honoring dependencies between systems and enforcing Rust's mutability rules. By default, this means that if System A reads a resource and System B writes the resource (and they have no order defined between them), then System A might execute before or after System B. We call these systems \"ambiguous\". In some situations this ambiguity might matter, in other situations it might not.\nBevy already has a system ambiguity detection system which enables users to detect ambiguous systems and resolve the ambiguity (either by adding ordering constraints or ignoring the ambiguity). Users could add systems to \"ambiguity sets\" to ignore ambiguities between systems in these sets:\n#[derive(AmbiguitySet)]\nstruct AmbiguousSystems;\n\napp\n  .add_system(a.in_ambiguity_set(AmbiguousSystems))\n  .add_system(b.in_ambiguity_set(AmbiguousSystems))\n\nThis was a bit hard to reason about and introduced more boilerplate than necessary.\nIn Bevy 0.9, we have replaced ambiguity sets with simpler ambiguous_with calls:\napp\n  .add_system(a)\n  .add_system(b.ambiguous_with(a))\n\nThis builds on the existing [SystemLabel] approach, which means you can also use labels to accomplish \"set-like\" ambiguity resolution:\n#[derive(SystemLabel)]\nstruct Foo;\n\napp\n  .add_system(a.label(Foo))\n  .add_system(b.label(Foo))\n  .add_system(b.ambiguous_with(Foo))\n\nBevy ECS Optimizations\n#\n\nauthors: @james7132, @JoJoJet\nWe had some huge performance wins in Bevy 0.9 thanks to @james7132:\n\nThe Query fetch abstraction was reworked to hoist common parts out of individual iteration, improving iterator performance on some benchmarks by ~10-20%. Query::get performance also saw some improvements.\nSome unnecessary branches were removed from our data access apis, improving performance across most of our ECS benchmarks by ~5-20%!\nThe parallel executor now starts running systems while the prepare_systems step is running, cutting out a lot of delay when there are many systems with very little work to do. This cut almost 1 millisecond from our many_foxes animation benchmark (~12% improvement). That is a very big deal!\nIterators now skip empty archetypes and tables when iterating over queries, which significantly reduces per-archetype iteration overhead when the archetype is empty.\n\n@JoJoJet also optimized Query::get_many access by replacing array::map with loops, optimizing get_many by ~20-30%!\nECS Change Detection Bypass\n#\n\nauthors: @alice-i-cecile\nBevy ECS automatically detects changes to components and resources thanks to some very fancy Rust usage.\nHowever sometimes, a user might make a change that they don't want to be detected. In Bevy 0.9, change detection can now be bypassed:\nfn system(mut transforms: Query&lt;&amp;mut Transform&gt;) {\n  for transform in &amp;mut transforms {\n    transform.bypass_change_detection().translation.x = 1.0;\n  }\n}\n\nEnum Reflection\n#\n\nauthors: @MrGVSV, @Davier, @nicopap\nBevy Reflect now has native support for Rust enums! Bevy Reflect is Bevy's \"Rust reflection system\", which allows us to access Rust type information about values and types dynamically at runtime.\nIn past versions of Bevy, we needed to hack around Bevy Reflect's lack of enum support by treating enum types as \"reflected values\", which required a lot more work for each type, and it provided less reflected information about the type:\n// Old\n#[derive(Copy, Clone, PartialEq, Debug, Default, Serialize, Deserialize, Reflect)]\n#[reflect_value(PartialEq, Serialize, Deserialize)]\nenum SomeEnum {\n  A,\n  B(usize),\n  C {\n    foo: f32,\n    bar: bool,\n  },\n}\n\n// New\n#[derive(Reflect)]\nenum SomeEnum {\n  A,\n  B(usize),\n  C {\n    foo: f32,\n    bar: bool,\n  },\n}\n\nNo more magic incantations!\nJust like other reflected types, Enum reflection provides a lot of new runtime functionality:\n// Access variant names\nlet value = SomeEnum::A;\nassert_eq!(\"A\", value.variant_name());\n\n// Get the variant type\nmatch value.variant_type() {\n  VariantType::Unit =&gt; {},\n  VariantType::Struct =&gt; {},\n  VariantType::Tuple =&gt; {},\n}\n\nlet mut value = SomeEnum::C {\n  foo: 1.23,\n  bar: false\n};\n\n// Read/write specific fields by name\n*value.field_mut(\"bar\").unwrap() = true;\n\n// Iterate over the entire collection of fields\nfor field in value.iter_fields() {\n}\n\n// Detect the value type and retrieve information about it\nif let TypeInfo::Enum(info) = value.type_info() {\n  if let VariantInfo::Struct(struct_info) = value.variant(\"C\") {\n    let first_field = struct_info.field_at(0).unwrap();\n    assert_eq!(first_field.name(), \"foo\");\n  }\n}\n\nDeriving Reflect on enums also automatically adds support for \"reflect-based serialization\", which as of Bevy 0.9 now has a much nicer syntax.\nOther Bevy Reflect Improvements\n#\n\nauthors: @MrGVSV, @makspll, @Shatur, @themasch, @NathanSWard\nWe've made a lot of other improvements to Bevy Reflect!\n\"Container\" Reflect traits (Map, List, Array, Tuple) can now be drained to get owned values:\nlet container: Box&lt;dyn List&gt; = Box::new(vec![1.0, 2.0]);\nlet values: Vec&lt;Box&lt;dyn Reflect&gt;&gt; = container.drain();\n\nReflected fields can now opt out of serialization without also opting out of reflection as a whole:\n#[derive(Reflect)]\nstruct Foo {\n  a: i32,\n  // fully invisible to reflection, including serialization\n  #[reflect(ignore)]\n  b: i32,\n  // can still be reflected, but will be skipped when serializing\n  #[reflect(skip_serializing)]\n  c: i32,\n}\n\nBoxed \"reflection type\" traits (Struct, Enum, List, etc) can now be converted to the more generic Box&lt;dyn Reflect&gt;:\nlet list: Box&lt;dyn List&gt; = Box::new(vec![1.0, 2.0]);\nlet reflect: Box&lt;dyn Reflect&gt; = list.into_reflect();\n\nIt is now possible to get owned variants of reflected types:\nlet value: Box&lt;Sprite&gt; = Box::new(Sprite::default());\nif let ReflectOwned::Struct(owned) = value.reflect_owned() {\n  // owned is a Box&lt;dyn Struct&gt;\n}\n\nArrays in the \"reflection path api\" can now use list syntax:\n#[derive(Reflect)]\nstruct Foo {\n    bar: [u8; 3],\n}\n\nlet foo = Foo {\n  bar: [10, 20, 30],\n};\n\nassert_eq!(*foo.get_path(\"bar[1]\").unwrap(), 20);\n\nReflected Lists now have a pop operation:\nlet mut list: Box&lt;dyn List&gt; = Box::new(vec![1u8, 2u8]);\nlet value: Box&lt;dyn Reflect&gt; = list.pop().unwrap();\nassert_eq!(*value.downcast::&lt;u8&gt;().unwrap(), 2u8);\n\nExample: Gamepad Viewer\n#\n\nauthors: @rparrett\nBevy now has a gamepad input viewer app, which can be run using cargo run --example gamepad_viewer from the Bevy repo.\n\nAxis and Button Settings Validation\n#\n\nauthors: @mfdorst, @targrub\n[InputAxis] and [ButtonSettings] now use getters and setters to ensure the integrity of the settings. Setters will return an error instead of allowing invalid state.\nFor example, attempting to set the \"press threshold\" of a button to a value lower than the \"release threshold\" will result in an error:\nbutton_settings.set_release_threshold(0.65);\n// this is too low!\nassert!(button_settings.try_set_press_threshold(0.6).is_err())\n\nScanCode Input Resource\n#\n\nauthors: @Bleb1k\nBevy 0.9 adds an Input&lt;ScanCode&gt; resource, which behaves like Input&lt;KeyCode&gt;, but ignores keyboard layout:\nfn system(scan_code: Res&lt;Input&lt;ScanCode&gt;&gt;, key_code: Res&lt;Input&lt;KeyCode&gt;&gt;) {\n  // 33 is the scan code for F on a physical keyboard\n  if scan_code.pressed(ScanCode(33)) {\n    log!(\"The physical F key is pressed on the keyboard\");\n  }\n  \n  if keycode.pressed(KeyCode::F) {\n    log!(\"The logical F key is pressed on the keyboard, taking layout into account.\");\n  }\n}\n\nTime Shader Globals\n#\n\nauthors: @IceSentry\nBevy shaders finally have access to built-in time values, removing the need for users to calculate time values and pass them in manually. Time is very useful in shaders, as it opens the doors to animating values.\nHere is a simple shader that animates between a black and red color using the time:\n@fragment\nfn fragment(in: FragmentInput) -&gt; @location(0) vec4&lt;f32&gt; {\n    return vec4&lt;f32&gt;(sin(globals.time * 10.0), 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);\n}\n\n\nBevy Shaders now have access to the following globals:\n\ntime: time since startup in seconds, wrapping to 0 after 1 hour\ndelta_time: time since the previous frame in seconds\nframe_count: frame count since the start of the app, wrapping to 0 after reaching the max size of a u32\n\nHigh Entity Renderer Slowdown Optimization\n#\n\nauthors: @TheRawMeatball\nBevy's renderer synchronizes entity state between the \"main world\" and the \"render world\", which enables parallel pipelined rendering. To implement this, we clear out the render entities every frame to ensure the integrity of the extracted state.\nHowever, it became apparent that the method we were using to clear entities each frame was incurring a per-entity cost that became notable at very high entity counts.\nIn Bevy 0.9, we have significantly optimized the entity clearing, which cuts the cost of clearing 5,000,000 entities from ~360 microseconds to ~120 microseconds. We are also considering a \"retained state\" extraction model, piggybacking on Bevy ECS's built in change detection, which would remove the need to clear entities entirely (and optimize the extraction processes more generally). Implementing that will be a much larger effort though!\nVertex Attributes Fully Optional\n#\n\nauthors: @IceSentry\nIn a previous release we made it possible to make vertex attributes optional by specializing on mesh vertex attributes. But we left a couple of the common attributes as required: the position and the normal. Bevy 0.9 finishes the job. All standard mesh vertex attributes are now completely optional. If your mesh doesn't need positions for some reason, Bevy won't stop you!\nExpose Multi Draw Indirect\n#\n\nauthors: @Neo-Zhixing\nWgpu has opt-in support for \"multi draw indirect\" apis on platforms that support them, which are a key piece of implementing efficient \"gpu driven rendering\". Bevy now exposes these apis through its \"tracked render pass\" abstraction, enabling developers to build render features using these apis.\nKTX2 Array / Cubemap / Cubemap Array Textures\n#\n\nauthors: Rob Swain (@superdump)\nBevy can now properly load KTX2 array, cubemap, and cubemap array texture assets, which opens the doors to scenarios like skyboxes:\n\nBevy doesn't yet have high level support for skyboxes, but we have an example that illustrates how this feature can be implemented by users\nCamera::viewport_to_world\n#\n\nauthors: @devil-ira\nIt is often desirable to convert a position \"on the screen\" to a ray at that position facing out from the camera. For example, if you want to click on something in a 3D scene to select it, you might cast a ray from that point in the camera's view and see if it intersect with any \"colliders\" in the scene.\nBevy cameras now have a viewport_to_world function, which provides this functionality:\nlet ray = camera.viewport_to_world(transform, cursor_position).unwrap();\nif let Some(entity) = physics_context.cast_ray(ray.origin, ray.direction) {\n  // select entity\n}\n\nThe following cursor-driven selection uses viewport_to_world to calculate the ray coming \"out\" of the cursor, then feeds it into the bevy_rapier physics library to detect and pick up the card under the cursor:\n\nMultiple Directional Lights\n#\n\nauthors: @kurtkuehnert\nBevy now supports multiple directional lights (the new limit is 10 at once). Much like we did for point lights, we will likely make this unbounded on platforms that support storage buffers in the future, but this was a nice first step that maintains compatibility on all platforms.\n\nSprite Rects\n#\n\nauthors: @inodentry\nSprites can now define \"rects\" that select a specific area of their texture to be used as the \"sprite\":\nSprite {\n  rect: Some(Rect {\n    min: Vec2::new(100.0, 0.0),\n    max: Vec2::new(200.0, 100.0),\n  }),\n  ..default()\n}\n\n\nThis is similar to how TextureAtlasSprite / \"sprite sheets\" work, but without the need to define a texture atlas.\nPlugin Settings\n#\n\nauthors: @cart, @mockersf\nIn past versions of Bevy, \"immutable\" Plugin settings were represented as normal ECS resources, which were read as part of plugin init. This presented a number of problems:\n\nIf a user inserted the plugin settings resource after the plugin was initialized, it would be silently ignored (and use the defaults instead)\nUsers could modify the plugin settings resource after the plugin had been initialized. This created a false sense of control over settings that could no longer be changed.\n\nThese were especially problematic and confusing for the WindowDescriptor resource, but it was a general problem.\nTo resolve this, in Bevy 0.9 we moved plugin settings onto the plugins themselves, and created new apis for overriding the default settings:\napp.add_plugins(DefaultPlugins\n  .set(AssetPlugin {\n    watch_for_changes: true,\n    ..default()\n  })\n  .set(WindowPlugin {\n    window: WindowDescriptor {\n      width: 400.0,\n      ..default()\n    },\n    ..default()\n  })\n)\n\nThis makes the connection between the settings and the plugin clear, and differentiates these \"plugin init\" settings from \"runtime configurable\" settings (which are still represented as ECS resources).\nPlugins Are Now Unique By Default\n#\n\nauthors: @mockersf\nPlugins are now unique by default. Attempting to add a unique plugin to an app more than once will result in an error. Plugins that are not intended to be unique can override the default is_unique method:\nimpl Plugin for MyPlugin {\n  fn build(&amp;self, app: &amp;mut App) {\n    app.add_system(some_system);\n  }\n\n  fn is_unique(&amp;self) -&gt; bool {\n    false\n  }\n}\n\nTask Pool: Nested Spawns on Scope\n#\n\nauthors: @hymm\nBevy's Task Pools now support \"nested spawns on scopes\":\nlet results = task_pool.scope(|scope| {\n    scope.spawn(async move {\n        scope.spawn(async move { 1 });\n        2\n    });\n});\n\nassert!(results.contains(&amp;1));\nassert!(results.contains(&amp;2));\n\nThis enables adding new tasks to the task pool scope while performing other tasks! This was a requirement for implementing the newly merged (but not yet implemented) Stageless RFC, but it enables new patterns for anyone spawning async tasks in Bevy!\nTask Pool Panic Handling\n#\n\nauthors: @james7132\nBevy uses its own custom async task pools to manage scheduling parallel, async tasks. In previous versions of Bevy, if a task panicked in one of these pools, it would be non-recoverable unless every scheduled task used catch_unwind (which isn't feasible). This would also permanently kill worker threads in the global task pools.\nBevy 0.9 resolves this problem by calling catch_unwind inside the task pool executors.\nHierarchy Query Methods\n#\n\nauthors: @devil-ira\nTo make navigating hierarchies easier, we've added some convenience methods to Query&lt;&amp;Children&gt; and Query&lt;&amp;Parent&gt;:\n#[derive(Resource)]\nstruct SomeEntity(Entity);\n\nfn system(children: Query&lt;&amp;Children&gt;, some_entity: Res&lt;SomeEntity&gt;) {\n  // iterate all descendents of some_entity \n  for entity in children.iter_descendants(some_entity.0) {\n  }\n}\n\nfn other_system(parents: Query&lt;&amp;Parent&gt;, some_entity: Res&lt;SomeEntity&gt;) {\n  // iterate all ancestors of some_entity \n  for entity in parents.iter_ancestors(some_entity.0) {\n  }\n}\n\nBevy UI: The Origin Is Now In The Top Left\n#\n\nauthors: @mahulst\nBevy UI now considers the \"top left\" of the window to be the \"origin\" and it extends \"downward\" (Y-down). To illustrate, consider the following cases where a widget spawned in the \"default\" location (at the origin).\nTop Left Origin (New)\n#\n\n\nBottom Left Origin (Old)\n#\n\n\nWe chose to make this change because pretty much the entire UI ecosystem uses top left as the origin (Web, Godot, GTK, GPU images, etc).\nIn the early days when Bevy was still in its infancy, I (@cart) originally opted for bottom left (Y-up) for consistency with Bevy's world space 2D and 3D coordinate systems. In theory, I figured this would make everything easier to reason about. But in practice, it turns out this consistency won us nothing. And the behavior defied users' expectations when it came to UI default behaviors. UIs tend to extend downward (from the top), not upward (from the bottom), so overriding the defaults was common practice.\nFortunately, in Bevy 0.9 we're now aligned with the rest of the ecosystem!\nBevy UI: Z-Indices\n#\n\nauthors: @oceantume\nBevy UI elements now have more control over their \"z index\" (whether or not they are \"in front\" or \"behind\" each other). In past versions of Bevy, this was determined entirely by hierarchy: children stack on top of parents and earlier siblings. This is a nice \"default\" and works for a good portion of UIs, but some types of UI need more control over element ordering.\nIf you are a web developer and you have ever reached for the z-index css property, that is the problem we're discussing here.\nBevy 0.9 adds a new ZIndex component, which is an enum with two modes:\n\nZIndex::Local(i32): Overrides the depth relative to its siblings.\nZIndex::Global(i32): Overrides the depth relative to the UI root. Setting this essentially allows UI elements to \"escape\" z-ordering relative to their parents and instead be ordered relative to the entire UI.\n\nUI items with a higher z-level within the context (local vs global) will show up in front of UI items with a lower z-level. Ties within a z-level fall back to hierarchy order. \"Later\" children stack on top of \"earlier\" children.\nTo illustrate, consider the following UI:\nroot (green)\n  child1 (red)\n  child2 (blue)\n\nBy default these all have a z-index of 0. The root is at the bottom and each subsequent child stacks \"on top\":\n\nIf we want the blue child to stack \"behind\" the earlier red child, we can set its z-index to a \"local\" value smaller than the default of 0:\nblue.z_index = ZIndex::Local(-1);\n\n\nIf we want the blue child to stack \"behind\" the green root, we can set its z-index to a \"global\" value smaller than the default of 0:\nblue.z_index = ZIndex::Global(-1);\n\n\nVery useful stuff!\nBevy UI Scaling\n#\n\nauthors: @Weibye\nBevy UI's global \"pixel scale\" can now be set using the UiScale resource:\n// Render UI pixel units 2x bigger\napp.insert_resource(UiScale { scale: 2.0 })\n\nThis allows developers to expose arbitrary scale configuration to users in cases where that flexibility is beneficial.\n\nAudio Playback Toggling\n#\n\nauthors: @lovelymono\nIt is now possible to toggle audio playback, which will flip between playing and pausing:\n// Old, manual toggling (still possible)\nif audio_sink.is_paused() {\n    audio_sink.play();\n} else {\n    audio_sink.pause();\n}\n\n// New, automatic toggling\naudio_sink.toggle();\n\nTime Scaling\n#\n\nauthors: @maniwani\nThe \"global\" time scale can now be configured on Time, which scales the values common functions like Time::delta_seconds() return.\ntime.set_relative_speed(2.0);\n\nIn cases where unscaled values are required, you can use the new \"raw\" variants of these functions:\n// The number of seconds elapsed since the last update, with time scaling taken into account.\nlet delta = time.delta_seconds();\n\n// The number of seconds elapsed since the last update, with time scaling ignored.\nlet raw_delta = time.raw_delta_seconds();\n\n\nTime Wrapping\n#\n\nauthors: @IceSentry\nSome scenarios, such as shaders, need to represent elapsed time values as f32, which will suffer from precision issues pretty quickly. To resolve this, Time has been extended to support \"time wrapping\":\n// Wrap once every hour\ntime.wrapping_period = Duration::from_secs(60 * 60):\n\n// If one hour and 6 seconds have passed since the app started,\n// this will return 6 seconds.\nlet wrapped = time.seconds_since_startup_wrapped_f32();\n\nWhat's Next?\n#\n\nHere are some of the things\n\nHigh Level Post Processing Stack: Now that we have the core post processing pipeline in place, we need to make a higher level system that makes it easier for users to select, configure, and re-order post processing effects on a per-camera basis. Additionally for performance reasons we want to combine as many post processing effects into a single pass as we can, so we need an opinionated set of post processing apis that facilitate this.\nMore Post Processing Effects: More anti-aliasing options (TAA, SMAA), more tonemapping algorithm options (Ex: ACES), SSAO\nAsset Preprocessing: We will be investing heavily in our asset pipeline, with a focus on:\n\nPre-processing assets to do expensive work \"during development time\", so Bevy Apps can be deployed with assets that are prettier, smaller, and/or faster to load.\nEnabling configuring assets with .meta files. For example, you could define a texture compression level, the filter it should use, or the target format.\n\n\nBevy UI Improvements: We will continue improving Bevy UI's functionality and expanding its widget library, with a focus on enabling editor experiences.\nMore Scene Improvements: Nested scenes, implicit defaults, and inline assets.\nBevy Editor: We will start prototyping Bevy Editor experiences, starting with scene editor tooling.\nStageless ECS: Now that the Stageless RFC is merged, we can start implementing stageless scheduling! See the RFC for an outline of the improvements coming. This will be a game changer!\n\nWe're also looking for experts in some key areas. Most of our current devs are focused on the efforts above, so if you have interest and experience in the following areas, we would love to hear from you!\n\nAnimation: Animation blending, procedural animation, and higher level animation systems.

And what a year it has been! Now seems like as good a time as any to look back on how far we've come, reflect a bit, and start thinking about what the next year of Bevy development will look like.\nFor those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. Bevy is also free and open source forever! You can grab the full source code on GitHub. We have a Quick Start Guide and a Bevy Book.

After months of working incognito, I released Bevy to the world. It was by no means complete, but it had most of the pillars in place to show the world what Bevy is (and could be): a modern and flexible renderer built on top of a modular Render Graph, a custom ECS with unrivaled ergonomics and competitive performance, 2D and 3D rendering features, asset handling, a modular app model that blurs the lines between engine developers and app developers, a custom UI system that integrates deeply with the engine, scenes, hot reloading, and blissfully productive iterative compile times.\n\n\nAugust 19: Absolutely Wild Public Reception\n\nJust a week after release we became the 3rd most popular /r/rust post of all time, hit #2 on Hacker News, received 2,200 Github stars, merged pull requests from 26 new contributors, gained 644 Discord members, and received sponsorships that brought us 37% of the way to our first funding goal.\n\n\nAugust 20: Reached our first funding goal ($1500 / month)\n\nEmbark became our first platinum sponsor, which brought us past our first funding goal, allowing me to work on Bevy full time without eating into my savings. This honestly set the course for the rest of the year of Bevy development.\n\n\nAugust 20: The Amethyst forum post: \"Bevy Engine - Addressing the elephant in the room\"\n\nThis helped establish the strengths of each project and identified various collaboration areas, marking the beginning of a fruitful relationship between the two communities.\n\n\nAugust 28: Reached our second funding goal ($2080 / month)\n\nAs of this point, I'm making \"state of Washington minimum wage\" working on Bevy. This marks the point where I start thinking about building and managing Bevy as \"my job\".\n\n\nSeptember 19: Bevy 0.2\n\nA month after the initial release we dropped another big one! This included a new async task system with significantly improved performance, initial Web platform support, parallel queries, a new transform system, joystick input, and some tasty Bevy ECS performance improvements.\n\n\nNovember 3: Bevy 0.3\n\nAnother month after Bevy 0.2 we had another big release! This one added initial Android and iOS support, WASM asset loading, touch input, asset reference counting, dependencies, and sub assets, GLTF scene loading, Bevy ECS query ergonomics, 100% lockless parallel ECS and other performance improvements, flexible mesh attributes, another transform system rewrite, gamepad settings, plugin groups, and dynamic window settings.\n\n\nDecember 19: Bevy 0.4\n\nWe somehow still managed to keep up the \"approximately once a month\" release cadence. We added a WebGL2 render backend, cross platform main functions, live shader reloading, flexible ECS parameter orders, simplified query filters, system inputs, outputs, and chaining, a more featureful and flexible ECS schedule implementation, \"fixed timesteps\", states, gltf improvements, spawning scenes as children, dynamic linking for drastically faster iterative compile times, a new text layout implementation, renderer optimizations, a new rust reflection crate (filling a major gap in the rust ecosystem), 3d texture assets, logging and profiling, hidpi rendering, timer improvements, task system improvements, and apple silicon support.\n\n\nApril 6: Bevy 0.5\n\nThe almost-one-release-a-month streak finally ended. But thats not because we slowed down our pace! This release was a big one. It added Physically Based Rendering (PBR), GLTF asset improvements, Bevy ECS V2: a complete from-scratch rewrite with a novel archetype/sparse-set hybrid storage model, an \"archetype graph\" for faster archetype changes, query caching, uber fast for-each iterators, a new system executor with system labels, explicit system ordering/dependencies, system sets, and increased parallelism, \"reliable\" change detection, and a full rewrite of the State system). We also added a rich text api, hidpi and 2d-world space text, world-to-screen coordinate conversions, a 3d orthographic camera and new scaling modes, flexible camera bindings in shaders, render layers, sprite flipping, color spaces, wireframe rendering, and more smaller tweaks that I don't have room for here.\n\n\nApril 14: The Bevy RFC process is unveiled\n\nInspired by the Rust RFC process, we added a way to collaboratively design and review Bevy APIs prior to implementing them. This generally isn't required, but for bigger changes it ensures we think deeply about what we are building, mitigates risk, and encodes designs and intents for future Bevy developers.\n\n\nJune 1: First public release of Bevy Assets\n\nBevy Assets is a public library of community developed Bevy plugins, crates, assets, games, and learning materials. The website is fed by structured toml files in the bevy-assets repo. It has its roots in the awesome-bevy repo, our old unstructured markdown document with a list of community projects. It is still hot off the presses, but we have big plans for it!\n\n\nJune 24: Reached our third funding goal ($4000 / month)\n\nReaching this goal marked the point where I started thinking about Bevy as a career. I'm not making \"market rate\" for my skills and I'm still making less than 1/4th what I made as a Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft, but I'm no longer \"just breaking even\" and I'm starting to save some money.\n\n\nAugust 2: Bevy hits 10,000 stars on Github\n\nI honestly can't believe we hit this so quickly.\n\n\nAugust 10: Bevy is now one year old!\n\nA Year By The Numbers\n#\n\n\n\n255 unique Bevy contributors on Github\n10,030 Github stars\n837 forks on Github\n1,501 pull requests (1060 merged) on Github\n1,112 issues (609 closed) on Github\n1,895 commits on Github\n153  Github Discussions\n110 Bevy Assets (plugins, crates, games, apps, and learning materials)\n57,349 downloads on crates.io\n93 @BevyEngine retweets of Bevy community content on Twitter\n4,871 Bevy Discord members\n771 community #showcase entries in the Bevy Discord\n420,250 messages in the Bevy Discord\n\nThings I'm Proud Of\n#\n\n\nOur Engine\n#\n\nI'm so happy that Bevy quickly went from being \"my engine\" to being \"our engine\". It was beautiful to see so many people find passion projects in Bevy. Take a look at the feature author lists in the release blog posts (after Bevy 0.1). This community is huge, wildly productive, and intensely collaborative!\nOur community is also extremely welcoming: we have an active Github Q&amp;A platform and #help channel on Discord (with over 82,000 messages). If you haven't already, hop in to our Discord and say hi!\nDevelopment Pace\n#\n\nJust look at all of the releases above and the sheer size of their feature sets! The upcoming Bevy 0.6 is gearing up to be another big one and I doubt we'll slow down any time soon. The results speak for themselves so I'll just shut up now.\nExperimentation and Iteration\n#\n\nWe didn't just build things once and assume that was the best we could do. When we started I called out that we needed the freedom to experiment and iterate. I put a big \"stability warning\" wherever I could to help manage expectations. And we sure did iterate! We rewrote the transform system ... twice. We completely rewrote Bevy ECS from scratch, leaving our hecs ECS roots behind (but not forgotten). We have a brand new renderer in the works. I've lost count of the number of \"next generation Bevy UI\" prototypes and designs people have put together.\nI know the lack of stability has been tough for some people, but I think this is the only way to build The Best Game Engine™ in a collaborative way. Things will start to stabilize soon ... and the wait will be worth it I promise.\nThe Bevy App Model\n#\n\nThis year we invested heavily in what I call The Bevy App Model. Bevy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApps\n\n are easy to understand, ergonomic to write, and modular via \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlugins\n\n. My goal was to blur the lines between engine developers and app developers. I think we absolutely nailed it:\n\n\nThere is no \"scripting interface\" separating \"engine logic\" from \"app logic\". We use a single language (Rust) for the whole stack. Rust feels modern with \"high level\" niceties while retaining low level performance and control. In my opinion, Bevy Apps are often simpler and more expressive than high level equivalents like Unity or Godot, thanks to the state-of-the-art Bevy ECS. And under the hood Bevy Apps are simpler because there are no internal translation layers between languages like C++ and scripting languages like C#:\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\n\n// This is a complete, self-contained, cross platform Bevy App\nfn main() {\n    App::new()\n        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n        .add_startup_system(setup)\n        .add_system(greet_players)\n        .run();\n}\n\nstruct Player {\n    name: String,\n}\n\nfn setup(mut commands: Commands) {\n    commands.spawn().insert(Player {\n        name: \"Cart\".to_string()\n    });\n}\n\nfn greet_players(query: Query&lt;&amp;Player&gt;) {\n    for player in query.iter() {\n        info!(\"hello {}!\", player.name);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nBevy Engine \"internals\" are entirely implemented using the same App Model that \"app developers\" use. \"App developers\" are \"engine developers\". \"Engine developers\" are \"app developers\".\n\n\nAs a result of (1), (2), and Bevy being free and open source, we foster a feeling of \"stack ownership\" that the other major players can't. Curious app developers can dig into Bevy's internals and feel immediately at home. The thousands of pull requests are a testament to that. We've seen an explosion of third party plugins being developed ranging from realistic physics to specialized tilemap renderers. Bevy's modular nature enables app developers to mix and match the pieces they like and \"build their own engine\". Bevy's core plugins like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssetPlugin\n\n and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRenderPlugin\n\n provide a common ground to ensure \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlugin\n\n interoperability. This composes nicely with the \"modular Render Graph\", which makes for an extremely pluggable engine.\nBevy ECS\n#\n\nContent Warning: I'm going to boast a lot here and make some hard-to-verify claims, which might offend some peoples' sensibilities :)\nBevy ECS is the interface we use to build both engine features and apps, so it was natural to give it focus last year. I honestly don't think it is controversial to say that Bevy ECS has pushed the envelope of what an ECS can be. Bevy ECS is the \"secret sauce\" (well ... **cough** ... \"open sauce\") that I believe uniquely positions us in the engine market. This is a result of meticulous experimentation, benchmarking, collaboration with other experts in the field, and unification of a lot of good ideas in the wider ECS ecosystem.\n\nThe most ergonomic ECS in existence. This might sound like hyperbole, but I haven't found any other offering in any language that can do what we do, as tersely as we do it. We have been constantly pushing the envelope here.\nMacro-free ergonomics. In Bevy we have an aversion to macros because they are DSLs (domain specific languages). We want to write Rust, not \"custom language we invented that happens to live inside Rust\". Most ECS-es that approach our level of ergonomics do it via macros. By building Bevy ECS directly on the Rust type system, we ensure Bevy code is \"pure rust\", the implementation is easier to debug, and users can extend it simply by implementing the relevant traits. This is one of our biggest innovations and I expect to see more projects learn from and adopt this model over time.\nThe first hybrid Archetypal / Sparse Set ECS: We are the first ECS to support both Archetypal and Sparse Set storage, side-by-side. Prior to this, people selecting an ECS either needed to pick a Sparse Set ECS for faster component add/removes but slower query iteration, or an archetypal ECS for slower add/removes but faster query iteration. With Bevy ECS, developers can select what storage to use per component. Via some clever algorithms, we select the best iteration strategy for a given set of components. Credit goes to @SanderMertens (the author of flecs) for coming up with the initial idea and designs for this. After that, Sander and I spent a lot of time collaborating on implementation details. Bevy was \"first to market\" here, but flecs has plans to adopt a similar model (and plans to innovate on top of what we've done). This type of mutually beneficial cross project collaboration warms my heart. Why \"hold cards close to your chest\" and \"compete\" when you can collaboratively build things together? A rising tide lifts all boats.\nLock-free Parallel ECS: We don't lock storages in Bevy ECS. When a System runs, it has full, unchecked, yet safe access to the data it pulls in. Everything is parallel by default. Everything Just Works™. You can easily define explicit before/after orderings between systems using System Labels, when that matters.\nAutomatic / parallel / global change detection: All changes are cheaply and automatically tracked in Bevy. And they can be ergonomically queried. This enables an entire class of optimizations that aren't possible in other ECS implementations. To my knowledge, we are the first to do this. All of the alternatives I'm aware of are either imperfect at capturing changes, require manual opt-in boilerplate, or (generally) both. Compare Unity DOTs change detection to Bevy ECS change detection to get a feel for the massive gulf we have crossed here.\n\nFor those who think ECS is over-hyped ... I totally get it. ECS is not the only way to build a good engine. Anyone who tells you otherwise either has an agenda or hasn't thought enough about the problem yet. ECS is, however, one of the best ways to standardize data representation and flow in a modular context. This is a problem that every engine needs to solve and the results almost always end up looking something like ECS, even if they don't use that label. ECS is also an extremely broad category, to the point of being almost meaningless. If thinking about Bevy ECS as \"Bevy Data Layer\" makes you happier, that is a completely valid mindset! Our APIs extend beyond traditional ECS definitions (and we have plans to go further). If you want to use an ECS-based engine because you've bought into the hype, I promise Bevy ECS can deliver :)\nGithub Popularity\n#\n\nWith over 10,000 stars, we are now the most popular Rust game engine on Github by a pretty wide margin. We are the 8th most popular game engine on Github. And Godot (currently holding the #1 spot with 40,900 stars) is starting to feel within our grasp, especially given their six year head start on us. If we make the same amount of progress next year, we'll be in the #2 spot! I'll be the first to say that popularity isn't everything. It isn't a measure of project maturity or feature set, but it is a measure of how many people we reach and resonate with. Winning hearts and minds is an important part of scaling an open source project. I'm proud of this progress and I hope the rest of the community is too.\nBevy Jobs\n#\n\nWe're starting to see paid Bevy jobs pop up and some of them are resulting in open-source contributions back to Bevy. This is the start of the next phase of Bevy's maturity: adoption by professionals. The \"stability warning\" still stands and studios should take that into account, but these developments excite me.\nThere is Always Room for Improvement\n#\n\n\nDelegating Work and Responsibility\n#\n\nFor most of this year, I worked very hard to maintain absolute control over every aspect of the project. This is just how I prefer to do things: I know what I want Bevy to be and I have pretty strong opinions about how that should be accomplished. I reviewed every pull request and design, read (almost) every issue and discord message, wrote every blog post, obsessed over every twitter message. This year was a long and painful process of learning what my limits are, watching the needs of the project grow past them, and then stubbornly refusing to let go in favor of burnout, letting things slip, or both at the same time.\nPart of this was me being a control freak to an irrational extent. Part of this was fueled by a more rational desire to hold off delegation until I could build trust in the ethics and technical chops of other Bevy contributors. In retrospect, I waited way too long.\nFortunately, after learning lessons the hard way, I finally started delegating a bit. I created a Triage Team and opened it up to interested Bevy contributors. I gave @mockersf the ability to merge small and relatively \"uncontroversial\" pull requests. @alice-i-cecile has been fantastic at wrangling issues and capturing and consolidating information. They're also heading up the new Bevy Book effort. @Ratysz built and generally \"owns\" the new Bevy ECS scheduler. There are plenty of other people shouldering responsibility now ... but I've gotta stop the list somewhere.\nI'm still learning how to delegate properly and I'm still not doing it enough. Bevy is growing rapidly and I promise I'll do my best to ensure I'm not the bottleneck going forward.\nI don't plan on giving up my \"benevolent dictator\" status any time soon. Rest assured that I still intend to review (almost) all pull requests and strictly dictate the direction of the engine. But don't be surprised when you start seeing more people drive increasingly large efforts. Scaling out is the only way to allow Bevy to grow at the pace it needs to.\nProject Planning and Communicating Project Direction\n#\n\nImmediately after the initial Bevy release, I said we needed to focus. I outlined three focus-areas for us:\n\nScenes: better scene format, inline assets, enabling / disabling systems\nPBR / Clustered Forward Rendering: PBR shaders, HDR, bloom, shadowing, all using clustered-forward rendering\nEditor-Ready UI: iterate on the current Bevy UI, add a canvas style drawing api, implement core widgets, theme-ability\n\nIf you have been paying any attention to what we've built over the past year, we clearly haven't focused exclusively on these things, and in some cases chose to go in completely different directions. Here is what we actually focused on (at various points during the year):\n\nBevy ECS and The Bevy App Model: core rewrite, smarter and more featureful parallel scheduler, states, ergonomics, change detection, performance improvements\nPBR and GLTF: Success! We got one ... but only if you pretend \"clustered\" wasn't in the focus-area title and ignore HDR, bloom, and shadowing!\nRenderer: old renderer optimizations and features, new renderer (will be released in the upcoming Bevy 0.6)\nPlatform support (iOS, Android, Web, as well as Desktop OS improvements)\n\nWe did make small iterative improvements to Scenes, but we barely scratched the surface of the topics in the focus-area issue. I no longer think enabling/disabling systems from within scenes is a good idea. There are experiments covering the other topics, but we clearly didn't \"focus\". Editor-Ready UI has completely changed course. We plan on building a brand new API instead of building on what we have currently. This has seen a lot of design work and people are constantly experimenting, but again ... not our focus.\nThere was a clear mismatch in reported vs actual priorities, especially when it comes to how I spent my time. Many of you probably recall \"the time we focused on rewriting the ECS\", \"the time we focused on PBR\", or \"the time we focused on the new renderer\" (aka right now). You won't remember \"the time we focused on Editor-Ready UI\", because it hasn't happened yet. This created problems for people who did try to break ground on these topics. They were free to experiment on their own, but without me investing time in building or \"blessing\" designs (because I insist on having the final say on these things), interested and motivated developers ended up \"directionless\".\nI believe we focused on the right things. We had more \"foundational\" work to do than I accounted for. Over time we all realized what the real focus areas should be, but we never got around to \"reporting that out\".\nGoing forward I plan on changing my approach to focus areas in the following ways:\n\nWe will have one or maaaybe two focus areas at a time, according to the number of unknowns and our \"bandwidth\".\nI will acknowledge that focus areas need immediate investment from me personally, for as long as I choose to occupy the \"benevolent dictator\" role. If I'm not actively working to unblock people from moving forward, it can't be a focus area (by definition).\nIf for whatever reason our focus needs to change when we discover new information, I will immediately report that out via a \"focus area change\".\n\nThe Old Renderer's Mid Level APIs\n#\n\nThe old renderer (pre Bevy 0.6) did a number of things right:\n\nUser-friendly ECS-driven high level apis for custom shaders with very little boilerplate. For example, check out this \"custom shader material\" app\nA modular \"low level\" Render Graph that enabled developers to easily slot new features into the render pipeline without centralized top-level orchestration, or to create entirely new render pipelines.\n\nHowever the mid-level apis between the render graph and the high level apis were complicated, full of abstractions and jargon, and in some cases, inefficient. As a result, this made the system hard to reason about and new developers struggled to understand it. I attribute this largely to focusing on making the high level and low level apis \"good UX\" and treating the mid level apis as \"glue\".\nI consider the old design of the mid-level apis to be a pretty costly \"mistake\". The new renderer will solve these problems, largely by flattening out abstractions and clarifying dataflow. I'm really excited about it. Live and learn I guess. Things are rarely perfect on your first try.\nIssue and Pull Request Response Times\n#\n\nI'm especially unhappy with how long it takes to merge PRs, especially those that make \"big\" changes. Part of this is intentionally tabling PRs in subject areas we aren't ready to commit time and brainpower to, but a lot of it is just a bandwidth / attention problem. I've been working with other core contributors to build systems that streamline this process:\n\nGiving merge rights to a small group of trusted and capable people. Currently this is just @mockersf and is scoped to \"uncontroversial\" prs.\nA \"community review system\" that forces a PR into my \"high priority review queue\" when there are enough approvals from the community.\n\nI don't think we've seen these systems work at their full capacity yet, as some of them are new and we're currently prioritizing preparing for the Bevy 0.6 release. Thousands of merged PRs a year is something to be proud of, but volume of pull requests is only going to get larger going forward. We need to be able to accommodate that.\nFilling Niches\n#\n\nAt this stage of development, Bevy is capable of building most classes of apps (2d, 3d, ui-focused, etc). However we aren't yet \"competitive\" in any of these niches. For example, for 2D workflows our tilesets are pretty limited, we're missing important optimizations like sprite batching, and we don't have a visual editor for building levels. These things can be built as third party plugins (and in fact, they have been), but Bevy needs to provide first class support out of the box. This past year we \"went wide\" and built up infrastructure to enable development in each niche, but going forward I want to see us focus on excelling in specific niches. This is largely just a matter of time as we build out features. But we need to be constantly aware of this: if we can't be the best at filling at least one niche, there is no point to any of this.\nI'm Not Drawing Enough Birds\n#\n\nNever thought I'd say those words but here we are. I have a pretty big backlog of \"custom Bevy bird avatar\" sponsorship rewards to make for people. Some people have been waiting a long time for theirs. I honestly regret adding this as a reward tier because it draws time away from me actually building Bevy (which I have clearly prioritized over making these avatars). I will likely retire this reward tier in the near future, but I promise I will get through the backlog for those that have already sponsored me at that tier. I am sincerely sorry for the delay.\nThe Next Year of Bevy\n#\n\n\nHere are some of my plans for the next year:\n\nBevy 0.6: In the very near future we will release Bevy 0.6, which will include a brand new renderer that is drastically more efficient, more capable, easier to understand, and much more extensible. It draws inspiration from the Bungie / Destiny and rafx architectures. This will include ports of all existing renderer features and initial implementations of features like shadows, viewports, material batching, and improved custom shaders.\nAsset Pipeline Maturity: The asset pipeline will get asset pre-processing, import configuration, and better dependency management. This will feed into renderer and scene improvements.\nNext Generation Bevy UI: We will build a new UI framework that takes advantage of Bevy ECS features, adds new features where necessary (such as \"reactivity\"), and makes UI development workflows more pleasant.\nThe Bevy Editor: We will break ground on the Bevy Editor, which will be a Bevy App building on top of the \"next generation Bevy UI\". We will start with scene editing functionality and then build out from there.\nScene Improvements: Scenes will get support for nested scenes, a nicer scene file format, and property overloading\nThe New Bevy Book: The current Bevy Book hasn't changed much since its initial release and doesn't cover much more than basic Bevy ECS usage. The new Book is already in progress and will be a much more comprehensive guide to all aspects of Bevy.\nNew Bevy ECS Features: We will likely get some form of \"reactive ECS\", entity-relationship indexing, and more granular and featureful parallel system scheduling\nAnimation: We will build a unified animation system that makes 2D and 3D animation easier and integrates naturally with the Bevy Editor\n2D Features: Sprite batching, more tileset features, layers, visual / interactive tooling in the Bevy Editor\n3D Features: Skeletal animation (that integrates with the Animation system), configurable / flexible / good looking shadows, at least one form of global illumination, more PBR properties, and visual / interactive tooling in the Bevy Editor\nBevy Game Jam: We will have at least one official Bevy Game Jam to promote Bevy, battle test apis, and give users more examples to build off of.\n\nI am relatively confident that we can make these things happen. We already have working prototypes for many of the features above and have started reaching consensus in a number of areas.\nHere are some predictions about Bevy's trajectory over the next year:\n\nI expect the Bevy 0.6 release to be immediately followed by an uptick in advanced built-in and third party renderer features (as a result of the new renderer).\nIn relatively short order, I expect to see more people reaching for Bevy as their preferred choice for 2D apps, thanks to improved tooling and performance.\nBy the end of the year, I expect people to start taking us seriously for 3D applications, thanks to a solid set of built in \"advanced rendering features\" and our extremely competitive renderer modularity.\nI expect the number of people getting paid to develop Bevy Engine, build Bevy apps, and make Bevy content to go way up.\nIf the \"Next Generation Bevy UI\" effort is successful, people wanting to build \"Rust GUI apps\" will start reaching for Bevy.\nWe will break out of the \"Rust gamedev enthusiast\" circles. By the end of the year, Bevy will be brought up more regularly in the wider gamedev community alongside conversations about Unity, Unreal, and Godot. Not necessarily as a direct competitor yet, but as a viable alternative for people that (1) want something new / innovative / different and (2) are willing to work around a smaller feature set and slightly less stable apis.\n\nIf any of this excites you, we would love your help! Check out our code on Github, start participating in the Bevy Community, and consider sponsoring my work to ensure I can continue building and leading this wildly ambitious project.\nI'm looking forward to spending the next year with you all!\n- @cart\n\n","id":"https://bevyengine.org/news/bevys-first-birthday/","title":"Bevy's First Birthday"},"https://bevyengine.org/news/bevys-second-birthday/":{"body":"@cart here (Bevy's creator, lead developer, and project manager) with another exciting announcement:\nIt has now been two years since the initial Bevy release!

We no longer hold releases back for specific features. Approximately every 3 months, we kick off the release process.\n\n\nFebruary 24: The first Bevy game is released on Steam: Molecoole\nFebruary 25: Bevy Jam #1\n\nThe first official Bevy Jam! 431 people joined, 74 people submitted games, and people left 1,618 ratings.

For example, we now have 17,830 total GitHub stars ... the number you will see in our repo. I've included the totals as reported last year as well, which can be used to calculate the change in the numbers since last year.\nThings I'm Proud Of\n#\n\n\nI'll try not to repeat myself here, but note that I am still extremely proud of the things I outlined in last year's retrospective.\nThe New Bevy Renderer\n#\n\nLast year we heavily invested in Bevy's renderer. At the start of the year, we built a new renderer from scratch. From that foundation we continued to iterate with success. Bevy's renderer is now:\n\nFaster: frustum culling, clustered forward rendering, sprite batching, more \"internal\" parallelism, lower render costs per entity, parallel pipelining (to be enabled soon ... I'll cover this in a bit)\nEasier to Understand: clearer layers of abstraction and dataflow (low: raw wgpu, mid: Render Graph, Extract/Prepare/Queue, PipelineCache, ShaderType, high: Material, Meshes)\nEasier to Extend: new high level Material system for simple custom shaders, camera driven rendering / per camera render graphs, flexible mesh vertex layouts, shader imports, modularized / extensible shader logic (such as our PBR logic), better Rust-&gt;GPU dataflow via ShaderType\nMore Featureful: More lighting options (point / directional / spot / spherical), shadows, shader imports and preprocessing, compute shaders, skeletal animation, camera driven rendering (render to texture, split screen, portals, etc), unlimited* point lights, compressed gpu textures, visibility inheritance, mesh tangent generation, better pipeline specialization, etc\n\nWe've invested a lot in making the renderer modular and extensible. That plus a clearer / more principled architecture has resulted in a serious uptick in renderer feature development, both upstream and in the wider ecosystem. Community projects like bevy_hikari, Chris Biscardi's Bevy shader videos on YouTube, and the increasingly pretty content in the #showcase channel on Bevy's Discord make it feel like we're on the right track here. People are more willing and able to write Bevy renderer code than they were with the previous renderer (including our core contributors).\nThere is still plenty of work to do, but I think we've largely laid the foundations at this point. Now we can now focus on features, performance, and improving the user experience.\nDelegation and Project Scaling\n#\n\nLast year I struggled a lot with scaling the project to account for a rapidly growing community, managing burnout, maintaining control, etc.\nI'm happy to say that while we haven't solved this problem, we're in a much better spot than we were before! We've defined a new \"maintainer\" role and filled it with capable people (@mockersf, @alice-i-cecile, @superdump). Maintainers have more freedom to merge code and make decisions, but we've also defined a \"controversial change\" process that allows me to dictate project direction when that is necessary (ex: ensuring consistent vision, resolving disputes, quality control, etc).\nAlice Cecile (@alice-i-cecile) has been working full time and has done a great job wrangling issues, merging uncontroversial PRs expediently, picking up areas like documentation, working on the ECS, and directing contributor energy in the right direction. This eased my burden significantly and enabled me to focus my energy in areas that need it the most (making core architectural decisions and building out core features, reviewing controversial / technical changes, managing the project, etc). They recently gave a fantastic talk about project management at Rust Conf!\nFrançois Mockers (@mockersf) has proven to be a technically proficient jack of all trades that has focused on making our CI top-tier, fixing critical issues before anyone else is even aware of them, and picking up high value work that is sometimes (regrettably) lower visibility. On top of that, they have demonstrated skill and interest in pretty much every pillar of the engine.\nRob Swain (@superdump) (our newest maintainer) has designed and implemented a huge portion of the pretty renderer features (lighting, shadows, clustered forward rendering, etc) and has clearly established themselves as a technical leader in that area. Bevy's renderer would not be what it is today without their dedication and expertise.\nA Thriving Ecosystem\n#\n\nBeing a young engine, Bevy still has a number of functionality gaps. But thanks to our focus on modularity, many of these gaps have already been filled by the community!\nThis is great because Bevy app developers are unblocked in these areas. The community gets to experiment with and iterate on ideas. And we (as Bevy engine developers) get to observe these spaces, learn what patterns work, and ultimately either adopt them or iterate on them when the time comes.\nIn particular, the following Bevy plugins are particularly popular and useful:\n\nPhysics: bevy_rapier (the official Rapier plugin maintained by the Rapier developers) is by far the best option if you need physics in your Bevy App. We will likely upstream some form of Rapier integration this year.\nUI: Bevy UI is still in the early stages of development. It is useful for basic game UIs (like health bars / huds / etc), but it isn't quite ready for more complicated UI-heavy scenarios. In these cases, bevy_egui provides a fully featured immediate-mode GUI solution that plays very nicely with Bevy ECS.\nAudio: Bevy's audio system is also still bare bones. For more flexible audio control, bevy_kira_audio has your back.\nEditor: Bevy doesn't yet have an official visual editor. bevy_editor_pls is a 3rd party Bevy Plugin that adds editor functionality to your game. Still a work in progress, but very useful!\nNetworking: Game networking is a pretty opinionated space, so it is unsurprising that there are a lot of options here! bevy_ggrs, bevy_renet, bevy_backroll, and naia are some of the most popular choices.\n\nThere are tons of other plugins listed on Bevy Assets.\nThanks to our first Bevy Jam, games listed on Bevy Assets, and the many Bevy games listed on itch.io, we now have hundreds of examples of Bevy games, many of which are open source.\nWhile we wait for the new Bevy Book, Bevy Cheatbook continues to be a top tier community developed learning resource.\nWe've also seen an uptick in educational Bevy content on YouTube. Tantan, Logic Projects, Chris Biscardi, PhaestusFox, Jeremy Chone, Griffin, and others have been creating some really interesting stuff.\nAs I recently ranted on Twitter, developer ecosystems are what really drive the success of an engine. And in my opinion the Bevy developer community is the primary driver of our success.\nPeople and Companies Are Using Bevy for Real Projects™\n#\n\nForesight, Noumenal, Molecoole, and Punchy / Fish Folk are some notable examples of projects that involve people that are getting paid for their work using Bevy. We've had 16 Bevy-related job postings on our Discord!\nI find it interesting that some of the most notable Bevy projects are tools / non-games (Foresight and Noumenal). It seems like the modularity of the engine makes us a compelling choice for tooling that requires a renderer and a principled app model.\nOf course, my \"Bevy is still young and we make breaking changes regularly\" warning still applies. Before picking us for a serious project: do your research, experiment with Bevy, and get a feel for what Bevy development looks like today. But I think given the progression we're seeing here, I might need to consider changing or removing that warning sooner than I thought. More and more projects are choosing Bevy and reporting positive experiences.\nThere Is Always Room For Improvement\n#\n\n\nBevy 0.6 Took Too long\n#\n\nI chose to hold back Bevy 0.6 until the new renderer was in a good spot, which in retrospect was a mistake. No sense in preventing people from using features that are ready just because another unrelated feature isn't ready! This was generally bad for morale and a large gap in public Bevy announcements was also suboptimal. In response to that drawn out release, we adopted a \"train release schedule\", which protected us from large, drawn out releases blocking on specific features. Bevy 0.7 and Bevy 0.8 used the new model and it resulted in faster, lower stress, and more predictable releases. We're still refining the process, but so far from what I can tell both Bevy developers and Bevy users are liking the new system.\nPipelined Rendering Isn't Actually Pipelined Yet\n#\n\nFor Bevy 0.6 we went through a lot of trouble to design and implement a renderer that supports parallel pipelining. The entire design philosophy revolves around that, such as the \"extract\" pattern for reading data from the \"main app\" to the \"render app\". However in the interest of getting Bevy 0.6 out the door ASAP, we made the call to hold off on enabling pipelining. There were some unanswered questions about how to handle threading in a way that accommodates edge cases like \"non send\" resources. I've had a branch that enables parallel pipelining since before Bevy 0.6 dropped.\nI continually deprioritized the last-mile effort required to enable pipelining in favor of building out other renderer features and unblocking other engine efforts. In some cases, I think this was the right call. User experience is generally way more important than eking out more performance. But letting these gains sit unrealized for about 8 months is regrettable, especially given how close we are and how much we've already invested. I will be prioritizing this last mile work.\nWe Need The Bevy Editor Now!\n#\n\nModern gamedev workflows for most game types require visual editors. Being able to visually and interactively move entities around in a scene is critical if you are building visual, interactive experiences. Bevy has a scene system, but without visual tooling it is hard to get any value out of it. Because of this, Bevy Engine developers don't have serious incentives or feedback loops to expand and improve the scene system, and Bevy users don't have serious incentives to adopt it.\nI've been deliberately holding back Bevy Editor development since Bevy first released so that we can build out Bevy's core systems in a focused way. I've been saying we need Bevy UI to be \"editor ready\" (aka ensuring it has the required features, widgets, patterns, and UX sorted out) before we start building out editor experiences. I no longer believe that. I think we should take a more iterative approach. Unlock the value now. Learn from experience. Refine. Iterate. Repeat. As Bevy UI evolves, we will need to rewrite aspects of the editor. Yes this is retreading ground, but I now believe it is Worth It.\nThe Rise And Fall of Bevy Merch\n#\n\nMany of you may have noticed that we announced the Bevy Merch store in February. There is a lot of demand for Bevy apparel / stickers / etc and we wanted to provide that option. Many people bought Bevy Merch and for awhile, life was good.\nSadly as the months progressed, I noticed that the print on my Bevy sweater started peeling after 3 washes. One other Bevy community member reached out and reported the same thing. Rather than sitting around and waiting for more issues to pop up, I opted to close Bevy Merch in May and offered everyone refunds out of my own pocket.\nIf anyone is looking for an apparel / printing service, please steer clear of Spring (our old merch provider). Their print quality and longevity is poor.\nWe will almost certainly find another merch provider and re-open the store, but before opening our doors to the public I will do thorough quality testing over a long period of time. The Bevy community put their trust in me and I put my trust in Spring (which they did not earn and promptly lost). When your money is involved you all deserve more thoroughness than I gave you. I am sincerely sorry. I won't make the same mistake again.\nDid We Learn From Last Year?\n#\n\nIt is important for organizations to learn from their mistakes. Now that we have a year in our \"birthday buffer\", its worth looking back to see how we did. Here is my list of \"improvement areas\" from last year's birthday post, followed by how I think we handled them this year:\n\nDelegating Work and Responsibility / Issue and Pull Response Times: As mentioned in the \"Things I'm Proud Of\" section, we made significant strides this year. But this is a battle we will be fighting for as long as Bevy continues to grow.\nProject Planning and Communicating Project Direction: This year we retired the old \"focus areas\" model in favor of a more organic approach. We have heavily embraced domain-specific project boards, which helps people follow along with what we are working on. This is an improvement over the old perpetually and actively wrong focus areas. And the direct ties to our GitHub issues and pull requests anchors these things in reality. That being said, I think there is still a gap when it comes to communicating our big / high level priorities in an easy-to-digest manner.\nThe Old Renderer's Mid Level APIs: We scrapped the old renderer entirely! I won't repeat what I said in the \"Things I'm Proud Of\" section, but I consider this largely resolved. On the topic of \"understandability\", I think our biggest gap at this point is documentation and learning paths.\nFilling Niches: Last year, I wanted us to focus on making Bevy a competitive experience for specific classes of apps. For our first year we went \"wide\" to cover as many domains as possible (2d, 3d, ui, etc) but within a given domain, there were gaps everywhere. We've definitely improved a lot here. 3D now has key features like skeletal animation, which was blocking pretty much every serious 3D game from being produced. Thanks to the new renderer and sprite batching our core 2D performance is in a much better spot and sprite-heavy games are now possible. That being said, in spirit, I don't think we've checked this box. When it comes to features, Bevy still isn't remotely competitive with the other big players in the space. That is certainly not a gap we can close in a year of time, but this year we really need to start focusing more on asset workflows, scenes, and editor experiences.\nI'm Not Drawing Enough Birds: For the first year of Bevy development, I offered a \"custom Bevy bird avatar\" reward tier for my sponsors. I was neglectfully slow when it came to drawing those birds. I'm happy to say that I successfully cleared my \"custom Bevy bird avatar\" backlog. Then I promptly removed that reward tier. It was fun, but my time is better spent building and managing Bevy.\n\nCan @cart Predict The Future?\n#\n\nFor our last birthday, I made some predictions for the next year. Lets see how well I did :)\n\nBevy 0.6 will be released in the near future: We did indeed release Bevy 0.6, but as mentioned above, it took another 4 months. That is a stretch of the phrase \"near future\".\nAsset Pipeline Maturity: The asset pipeline did not get asset pre-processing, import configuration, or better dependency management. This area is my primary focus for the next release cycle, but it was deprioritized last year. However we have done a lot of design work and experimentation in preparation for this.\nNext Generation Bevy UI: We did not meaningfully rework Bevy UI to improve the user experience or capabilities (other than swapping out the stretch layout lib for taffy, which fixed the extremely poor nested layout performance). Since Bevy 0.8 dropped, we have started ramping up our efforts here and consolidating our plans to make Bevy UI excellent. But third party UI plugins like bevy_egui currently still provide a more pleasant and featureful experience.\nBreak Ground on The Bevy Editor: We did not break ground on the Bevy Editor. As mentioned above, we need to start prioritizing this work.\nPredicted Scene Improvements: We did not get support for nested scenes, make the scene format prettier, or add property overloading. We have a new PR for a prettier scene format that builds on all of the Bevy Reflect work we did last year, but we are still reviewing it.\nThe New Bevy Book: We did make progress on the new Bevy Book, but we have not released it yet.\nPredicted Bevy ECS Features: We invested heavily in Bevy ECS, but we did not get \"reactive ECS\" / entity-relationship indexing. The parallel system scheduling api was improved, but we did not make it more granular (ex: \"stageless ECS\" is nearly ready, but we haven't merged it yet).\nUnified Property Animation System: We did do some design work (RFC 49, RFC 51) and there were some proposed implementations (PR 1429), but we have not merged an implementation yet.\nPredicted 2D Features: We did implement sprite batching and sprite render layers! We didn't meaningfully add tileset workflow improvements (3rd party crates like bevy_ecs_tilemap are often still preferable). And we also didn't add visual editor workflows (because the Bevy Editor doesn't exist yet).\nPredicted 3D Features: We did implement skeletal animation, configurable / flexible / good looking shadows, and added a few more PBR Material configuration options! We did not add a global illumination implementation (although 3rd party plugins like bevy-hikari now exist). We also didn't add visual editor workflows (again, because the Bevy Editor doesn't exist yet).\nFirst Bevy Game Jam: We did indeed have our first Bevy Jam!\n\nAs you can see, I largely failed to predict the future. Many of my predictions were in the vein of \"higher level asset and editor driven workflows\", but we ended up focusing on other pillars like the Bevy Renderer, Bevy ECS, Bevy Reflect, and platform support (mainly Web, some iOS and Android).\nI think we made the right calls here: we had a lot of foundational work to do, especially on the rendering front. Now that we've largely fleshed out Bevy's core (and code driven workflows), we can spend the next year realizing our plans for higher level editor driven workflows. Note that while our focus is shifting in this direction, we still plan to make code-first workflows first class and pleasant!\nThe Next Year of Bevy\n#\n\n\nHere are some of our \"big ticket\" items planned for the next year. I'm keeping this list smaller and more scoped than last year because some of these items are huge efforts and I was clearly overconfident in my predictions last year. That being said, I think we now have a better understanding of where we are in our \"tech tree\", we've started scaling out the Bevy Org and delegating effectively, and we are more capable of prioritizing these things (instead of needing to direct efforts to other foundational pieces). I believe we will make all of these things happen.\n\nThe Bevy Editor: This year, we will start experimenting in the \"visual scene editing\" space. By the end of the year, I would like to have basic scene editing workflows proved out in a \"minimum viable product\" fashion.\nBevy Assets: We will add asset preprocessing (optimizing and processing assets at development time, such as precompiling shaders), which is a critical piece of modern gamedev. This will enable faster asset loading, smaller CPU and GPU memory footprints, per-asset import configuration stored in the filesystem, and smaller deployed app sizes.\nBevy UI: Right now we have a reasonable DOM-like core. This year, we will flesh out what it means to define Bevy UI widgets, improve the ergonomics of defining UI trees, sort out hierarchical UI event handling, and explore higher level dataflow (such as \"reactivity\"). This will be developed in parallel with the Bevy Editor, which will dogfood Bevy UI and prove out patterns.\nBevy Scenes: Scenes will get a prettier format, support scene nesting, and scene property overloading. These features will be developed in parallel with the Bevy Editor to ensure the experience is cohesive and pleasant.\nBevy ECS: We will merge \"stageless\" ECS, making it easier / clearer for systems to depend on changes from other systems and resolving some of the biggest remaining UX issues in Bevy ECS.\nThe New Bevy Book: We will replace the current Bevy Book with the New Bevy Book. This will be an iterative process. I care more about opening the doors to community Bevy Book development and building that into our developer culture than achieving specific milestones here. We've put this off for too long.\n\nWe have plenty of other work in the pipeline, but I'm keeping this scoped to highlight the areas I believe we should be focusing on (and where I will personally be directing my own efforts as the project lead).\nBevy Jam #2 is also coming up on August 19th. Game jams are a great way to dive in to game development, even if you have never built a game (or used Bevy)! They are also a great way to meet like minded people. I highly recommend participating. I personally had a blast during the last one!\nIf any of this excites you, we would love your help! Check out our code on GitHub, start participating in the Bevy Community, and consider sponsoring our work to ensure we can continue building and leading this wildly ambitious project.\nThis year is going to be a big one for Bevy. I'm looking forward to spending it with you all!\n- @cart\n\n","id":"https://bevyengine.org/news/bevys-second-birthday/","title":"Bevy's Second Birthday"},"https://bevyengine.org/news/introducing-bevy/":{"body":"\nAfter months of work, I am ecstatic to finally announce Bevy Engine!\nBevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine and app framework built in Rust. It is free and open-source forever!\n\nIt has the following design goals:\n\nCapable: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set\nSimple: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users\nData Focused: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm\nModular: Use only what you need. Replace what you don't like\nFast: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel\nProductive: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn't fun\n\nBevy has a number of features that I think set it apart from other engines:\n\nBevy ECS: A custom Entity Component System with unrivaled usability and blisteringly-fast performance\nRender Graphs: Easily build your own multi-threaded render pipelines using Render Graph nodes\nBevy UI: A custom ECS-driven UI framework built specifically for Bevy\nProductive Compile Times: Expect changes to compile in ~0.8-3.0 seconds with the \"fast compiles\" config\n\nIt also has many features most people expect from a modern, general purpose engine:\n\nCross Platform: Windows, MacOS, and Linux (with planned support for mobile and web)\n3D: Lights, meshes, textures, MSAA, and GLTF loading\nSprites: Render individual images as sprites, render from sprite sheets, and dynamically generate new sprite sheets\nAssets: An extensible, event driven asset system that loads assets asynchronously in background threads\nScenes: Save ECS Worlds to human-readable scene files and load scene files into ECS Worlds\nPlugins: All engine and app features are implemented as modular plugins\nSound: Load audio files as assets and play them from within systems\nMultiple Render Backends: Vulkan, DirectX 12, and Metal (with more on the way thanks to wgpu)\nData Driven Shaders: Easily bind ECS components directly to shader uniforms\nHot Asset Reloading: Automatically reload changes to assets at runtime without recompiles or restarts\nEvents: Efficiently consume and produce Events from within ECS systems\nProperties: Dynamically get and set component fields using a string version of their names\nHierarchical Transforms: Create parent-child relationships between entities that propagate Transforms down the hierarchy\n\nThat being said, Bevy is still in the very early stages. I consider it to be in the \"prototyping\" phase: features are missing, APIs will change, and documentation is sparse. I don't yet recommend using Bevy in serious projects unless you are willing to deal with gaps and instability.\nHopefully at this point you are either (1) jazzed about Bevy or (2) not reading anymore. If you want to dive in right now, The Bevy Book is the best place to get started. You can also keep reading to find out what the current state of Bevy is and where we'd like to take it.\nQuick note to the reader: in this article you will find text formatted like this: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexture\n\n\nThis formatting indicates that the text is a Rust type that links to API documentation. I encourage you to click on anything that seems interesting to you!\nBevy Apps\n#\n\nFirst, lets see what a Bevy App actually looks like. The simplest App looks like this:\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\n\nfn main() {\n    App::build().run();\n}\n\nThats it! This App pulls in no features and literally does nothing. Running the program would just immediately terminate. We can make it a little more interesting by doing this:\nfn main() {\n    App::build()\n        .add_default_plugins()\n        .run();\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadd_default_plugins()\n\n adds all of the features you probably expect from a game engine: a 2D / 3D renderer, asset loading, a UI system, windows, input, etc\nYou can also register the default \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlugins\n\n manually like this:\nfn main() {\n    App::build()\n        .add_plugin(CorePlugin::default())\n        .add_plugin(InputPlugin::default())\n        .add_plugin(WindowPlugin::default())\n        .add_plugin(RenderPlugin::default())\n        .add_plugin(UiPlugin::default())\n        /* more plugins here ... omitted for brevity */\n        .run();\n}\n\nAnd of course you can also create your own plugins. In fact, all engine and game logic is built using plugins. Hopefully now you understand what we mean by modular: you are free to add/remove plugins based on your project's unique needs. However I expect that most people will stick to \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadd_default_plugins()\n\n for simplicity, at least initially.\nBevy ECS\n#\n\nAll Bevy engine and game logic is built on top of a custom Entity Component System (or ECS for short). Entity Component Systems are a software paradigm that involves breaking data up into Components. Entities are unique ids assigned to groups of Components. For example, one entity might might have a Position and Velocity component, whereas another entity might have a Position and UI component. Systems are logic that runs on a specific set of component types. You might have a movement system that runs on all entities with a Position and Velocity component.\nThe ECS pattern encourages clean, decoupled designs by forcing you to break up your app data and logic into its core components.\nUnlike other Rust ECS implementations, which require complex lifetimes, traits, builder patterns, or macros, Bevy ECS uses normal Rust datatypes for all of these concepts:\n\nComponents: normal Rust structs\nSystems: normal Rust functions\nEntities: a type containing a unique integer\n\nThere are already plenty of great introductions to the ECS paradigm, so I'll leave \"getting up to speed on ECS\" as an exercise for the reader and skip right to what makes Bevy's ECS so special:\nErgonomics\n#\n\nI'm going to make a wild (and unverifiable) claim here: Bevy ECS is the most ergonomic ECS in existence:\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\n\nstruct Velocity(f32);\nstruct Position(f32);\n\n// this system spawns entities with the Position and Velocity components\nfn setup(mut commands: Commands) {\n    commands\n        .spawn((Position(0.0), Velocity(1.0),))\n        .spawn((Position(1.0), Velocity(2.0),));\n}\n\n// this system runs on each entity with a Position and Velocity component\nfn movement(mut position: Mut&lt;Position&gt;, velocity: &amp;Velocity) {\n    position.0 += velocity.0;\n}\n\n// the app entry point. hopefully you recognize it from the examples above!\nfn main() {\n    App::build()\n        .add_default_plugins()\n        .add_startup_system(setup.system())\n        .add_system(movement.system())\n        .run();\n}\n\nThat is a complete self-contained Bevy app with automatic parallel system scheduling and global change detection. In my opinion, you won't find any ECS with better clarity or ergonomics. Building games (and engines) involves writing a large number of systems, so I heavily invested in making ECS code easy to write and easy to read.\nPerformance\n#\n\nOne of the reasons the ECS paradigm is so popular is that it has the potential to make game logic super fast, primarily for these two reasons:\n\nIteration Speed: Components are packed tightly together to optimize for cache-locality, which makes iterating over them blazing fast\nParallelism: Systems declare read/write dependencies, which enables automatic and efficient lock-free parallel scheduling\n\nBevy ECS does both of these things about as well as it can. According to the popular ecs_bench benchmark, Bevy ECS is the fastest Rust ECS by a pretty wide margin:\nSystem Iteration (in nanoseconds, less is better)\n#\n\n\nWorld Setup (in nanoseconds, less is better)\n#\n\n\nNote that ecs_bench is a single threaded benchmark, so it doesn't illustrate the multi-threading capabilities of these framework. And as always, please be aware that ecs_bench is a micro benchmark and it doesn't illustrate the performance of a complex game. There is a lot of nuance in the ECS performance space and each of the ECS implementations above will perform differently under different workloads.\nI have pushed my version of ecs_bench here if anyone wants to double-check my methodology. For some reasonable amount of time I will post updates here if anyone reports a problem or my results are not (on average) reproducible.\nFeatures\n#\n\nNow you might be thinking \"Ok @cart, so Bevy ECS has great performance and ergonomics, but surely this means you had to compromise on features!\"\n... NOPE Bevy has you covered:\nFor Each Systems\n#\n\n// \"for each systems\" run once on each entity containing the given components\nfn system(position: Mut&lt;Position&gt;, velocity: &amp;Velocity) {\n    // do something\n}\n\nQuery Systems\n#\n\n// this \"query system\" is the same as the system above, but gives you control over iteration\nfn system(mut query: Query&lt;(&amp;Position, &amp;mut Velocity)&gt;) {\n    for (position, mut velocity) in &amp;mut query.iter() {\n        // do something\n    }\n}\n\nChange Detection\n#\n\n// Added&lt;T&gt; queries only run when the given component has been added\nfn system(mut query: Query&lt;Added&lt;Position&gt;&gt;) {\n    for position in &amp;mut query.iter() {\n        // do something\n    }\n}\n\n// Mutated&lt;T&gt; queries only run when the given component has been mutated\nfn system(mut query: Query&lt;Mutated&lt;Position&gt;&gt;) {\n    for position in &amp;mut query.iter() {\n        // do something\n    }\n}\n\n// Changed&lt;T&gt; queries only run when the given component has been added or mutated\nfn system(mut query: Query&lt;Changed&lt;Position&gt;&gt;) {\n    for position in &amp;mut query.iter() {\n        // do something\n    }\n}\n\n// query.removed&lt;T&gt;() will iterate over every entity where the component T was removed this update\nfn system(mut query: Query&lt;&amp;Position&gt;&gt;) {\n    for entity in query.removed::&lt;Velocity&gt;() {\n        // do something\n    }\n}\n\nMultiple Queries\n#\n\nfn system(mut wall_query: Query&lt;&amp;Wall&gt;, mut player_query: Query&lt;&amp;Player&gt;) {\n    for player in &amp;mut player_query.iter() {\n        for wall in &amp;mut wall_query.iter() {\n            if player.collides_with(wall) {\n                println!(\"ouch\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nEntity Queries and Direct Component Access\n#\n\nfn system(mut entity_query: Query&lt;Entity&gt;, mut player_query: Query&lt;&amp;Player&gt;) {\n    for entity in &amp;mut entity_query.iter() {\n       if let Some(player) = player_query.get::&lt;Player&gt;(entity) {\n           // the current entity has a player component\n       }\n    }\n}\n\nResources\n#\n\n// Res and ResMut access global resources \nfn system(time: Res&lt;Time&gt;, score: ResMut&lt;Score&gt;) {\n    // do something\n}\n\n// you can use Resources in any system type\nfn system(time: Res&lt;Time&gt;, mut query: Query&lt;&amp;Position&gt;) {\n    // do something\n}\nfn system(time: Res&lt;Time&gt;, &amp;Position) {\n    // do something\n}\n\n\"Local\" System Resources\n#\n\n// Local&lt;T&gt; resources are unique per-system. Two instances of the same system will each have their own resource. Local resources are automatically initialized to their default value.\nfn system(state: Local&lt;State&gt;, &amp;Position) {\n    // do something\n}\n\nEmpty Systems\n#\n\n// for the hyper-minimalists\nfn system() {\n    // do something\n}\n\nWith/Without Filters\n#\n\n// only runs on entities With or Without a given component\nfn system(mut query: Query&lt;Without&lt;Parent, &amp;Position&gt;&gt;) {\n    for position in &amp;mut query.iter() {\n        // do something\n    }\n}\n\nThread-Local Systems\n#\n\n// systems that must run on the main thread with exclusive access to World and Resources\nfn system(world: &amp;mut World, resources: &amp;mut Resources) {\n    // do something\n}\n\nStages\n#\n\n// the scheduler provides Stages as a way to run sets of systems in order  \nfn main() {\n    App::build()\n        // adds a system to the default stage: \"update\" \n        .add_system(movement.system())\n        // creates a new stage after \"update\"\n        .add_stage_after(\"update\", \"do_things\")\n        .add_system_to_stage(\"do_things\", something.system())\n}\n\nCommands\n#\n\n// use Commands to queue up World and Resource changes, which will be applied at the end of the current Stage\nfn system(mut commands: Commands) {\n    commands.spawn((Position(0.0), Velocity(1.0)));\n}\n\n// Commands can also be used alongside other types\nfn system(mut commands: Commands, time: Res&lt;Time&gt;, mut query: Query&lt;&amp;Position&gt;) {\n    // do something\n}\n\nHow Do Function Systems Work?\n#\n\nBeing able to use Rust functions directly as systems might feel like magic, but I promise it's not! You may have noticed that we do this when registering systems in our App:\nfn some_system() { }\n\nfn main() {\n    App::build()\n        .add_system(some_system.system())\n        .run();\n}\n\nThe .system() call takes the some_system function pointer and converts it to a Box&lt;dyn System&gt;. This works because we implement the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntoQuerySystem\n\n trait for all functions that match a certain set of function signatures.\nGood Bones\n#\n\nBevy ECS actually uses a heavily forked version of the minimalist Hecs ECS. Hecs is an efficient single-threaded archetypal ECS. It provides the core \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchetype\n\n, and internal \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuery\n\n data structures. Bevy ECS adds the following on top:\n\nFunction Systems: Hecs actually has no concept of a \"system\" at all. You just run queries directly on the World. Bevy adds the ability to define portable, schedulable systems using normal Rust functions.\nResources: Hecs has no concept of unique/global data. When building games, this is often needed. Bevy adds a Resource collection and resource queries\nParallel Scheduler: Hecs is single threaded, but it was designed to allow parallel schedulers to be built on top. Bevy ECS adds a custom dependency-aware scheduler that builds on top of the \"Function Systems\" mentioned above.\nOptimization: Hecs is already plenty fast, but by modifying some of its internal data access patterns, we were able to improve performance significantly. This moved it from \"fast enough\" to \"the fastest\" (see the benchmark above to compare Bevy ECS to vanilla Hecs).\nQuery Wrappers: The Query Bevy ECS exports is actually a wrapper around Hecs Queries. It provides safe, scoped access to the World in a multi-threaded context and improves the ergonomics of iteration.\nChange Detection: Automatically (and efficiently) tracks component add/remove/update operations and exposes them in the Query interface.\nStable Entity IDs: Almost every ECS (including Hecs) uses unstable entity ids that cannot be used for serialization (scenes / save files) or networking. In Bevy ECS, entity ids are globally unique and stable. You can use them in any context!\n\nIn the near future I will file an issue on the Hecs git repo offering to upstream whatever changes they want from Bevy ECS. I have a feeling they won't want the \"high level\" stuff like function systems and parallel scheduling, but I guess we'll see!\nBevy UI\n#\n\n\nBevy has a custom, but familiar UI system based on the \"flex box\" model. Well... semi-custom, but more on that later. In the beginning, I heavily considered using one of the many great pre-made UI solutions in the Rust ecosystem. But each of these frameworks felt in some way \"separate\" from the data-driven ECS approach at the core of Bevy. If we took a framework like Druid, which is top-of-its class in terms of design, and then shoe-horned it into the Bevy data / event model, that would compromise the Druid design and Bevy+Druid would end up being less compelling than just using Druid as a standalone framework.\nI decided that the only way Bevy could even hope to bring something compelling to the table was to fully embrace the Bevy way of doing things.\nBevy UI directly uses the existing ECS, hierarchy, transform, event, asset, and scene systems at the core of Bevy. Because of this, Bevy UI automatically gets features like hot-reloading of UI scene files, async texture loading, and change detection. A shared architecture means that improvements to any of these systems feed directly into Bevy UI. I am not yet convinced that this approach will produce the best UI framework, but I am convinced that it will produce the best UI framework in the context of a Bevy App.\nWe are still in the experimental stages and I expect some things to change, but the patterns we've found so far are very promising. Also keep in mind that currently the best way to compose Bevy UIs is with code, but we are in the process of designing a new file format for scenes that should make declarative, file based UI composition much nicer than it currently is.\nBuilding Blocks\n#\n\nIn Bevy, a UI element is just an ECS Entity with a \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNode\n\n component. Nodes are rectangles with a width and height, and are positioned using the same \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransform\n\n component used elsewhere in Bevy. The \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStyle\n\n component is used to determine how the Node is rendered, sized, and positioned.\nThe easiest way to add a new node (with all of the required components) is like this:\ncommands.spawn(NodeComponents::default())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNodeComponents\n\n is a \"component bundle\", which Bevy uses to make spawning entities of various \"types\" easier.\nLayout\n#\n\nFor layout, Bevy uses a fantastic 100% Rust flexbox implementation called Stretch. Stretch provides the algorithms for positioning rectangles in 2D space according to the flexbox spec. Bevy exposes flex properties inside the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStyle\n\n component mentioned above and renders rectangles with the positions and sizes that Stretch outputs. Bevy uses its own z-layering algorithm to \"stack\" elements on top of each other, but its basically the same one that HTML/CSS uses.\nRelative Positioning\n#\n\nNodes are positioned relative to each other by default:\n\ncommands\n    .spawn(NodeComponents {\n        style: Style {\n            size: Size::new(Val::Px(100.0), Val::Px(100.0)),\n            ..Default::default()\n        },\n        material: materials.add(Color::rgb(0.08, 0.08, 1.0).into()),\n        ..Default::default()\n    })\n    .spawn(NodeComponents {\n        style: Style {\n            size: Size::new(Val::Percent(40.0), Val::Percent(40.0)),\n            ..Default::default()\n        },\n        material: materials.add(Color::rgb(1.0, 0.08, 0.08).into()),\n        ..Default::default()\n    });\n\nAbsolute Positioning\n#\n\nYou can \"absolutely\" position a Node relative to its parent's corners like this:\n\ncommands\n    .spawn(NodeComponents {\n        style: Style {\n            size: Size::new(Val::Percent(40.0), Val::Percent(40.0)),\n            position_type: PositionType::Absolute,\n            position: Rect {\n                top: Val::Px(10.0),\n                right: Val::Px(10.0),\n                ..Default::default()\n            },\n            ..Default::default()\n        },\n        material: materials.add(Color::rgb(0.08, 0.08, 1.0).into()),\n        ..Default::default()\n    });\n\nParenting\n#\n\nJust like any other Entity, Nodes can have children. Children are positioned and scaled relative to their parent. By default, children will always appear in front of their parents.\n\ncommands\n    .spawn(NodeComponents {\n        style: Style {\n            size: Size::new(Val::Percent(60.0), Val::Percent(60.0)),\n            position_type: PositionType::Absolute,\n            position: Rect {\n                top: Val::Px(10.0),\n                right: Val::Px(10.0),\n                ..Default::default()\n            },\n            ..Default::default()\n        },\n        material: materials.add(Color::rgb(0.08, 0.08, 1.0).into()),\n        ..Default::default()\n    })\n    .with_children(|parent| {\n        parent\n            .spawn(NodeComponents {\n                style: Style {\n                    size: Size::new(Val::Px(50.0), Val::Px(50.0)),\n                    ..Default::default()\n                },\n                material: materials.add(Color::rgb(0.5, 0.5, 1.0).into()),\n                ..Default::default()\n            });\n    });\n\nFlexbox\n#\n\nI won't cover how flexbox works here, but you can use all of the same \"flex\" properties you would use in a web context. Here is an example of how you would center two Nodes vertically and horizontally within their parent:\n\ncommands\n    .spawn(NodeComponents {\n        style: Style {\n            size: Size::new(Val::Percent(100.0), Val::Percent(100.0)),\n            justify_content: JustifyContent::Center,\n            align_items: AlignItems::Center,\n            ..Default::default()\n        },\n        material: materials.add(Color::rgb(0.04, 0.04, 0.04).into()),\n        ..Default::default()\n    })\n    .with_children(|parent| {\n        parent\n            .spawn(NodeComponents {\n                style: Style {\n                    size: Size::new(Val::Px(80.0), Val::Px(80.0)),\n                    ..Default::default()\n                },\n                material: materials.add(Color::rgb(0.08, 0.08, 1.0).into()),\n                ..Default::default()\n            })\n            .spawn(NodeComponents {\n                style: Style {\n                    size: Size::new(Val::Px(80.0), Val::Px(80.0)),\n                    ..Default::default()\n                },\n                material: materials.add(Color::rgb(1.0, 0.08, 0.08).into()),\n                ..Default::default()\n            });\n    });\n\nText and Images\n#\n\nNodes can also have Text and Image components, which affect the inferred sizes of nodes.\n\ncommands\n    .spawn(TextComponents {\n        text: Text {\n            value: \"Hello from Bevy UI!\".to_string(),\n            font: asset_server.load(\"FiraSans-Bold.ttf\").unwrap(),\n            style: TextStyle {\n                font_size: 25.0,\n                color: Color::WHITE,\n            },\n        },\n        ..Default::default()\n    })\n    .spawn(ImageComponents {\n        style: Style {\n            size: Size::new(Val::Px(200.0), Val::Auto),\n            position_type: PositionType::Absolute,\n            position: Rect {\n                top: Val::Px(10.0),\n                right: Val::Px(10.0),\n                ..Default::default()\n            },\n            ..Default::default()\n        },\n        material: materials.add(asset_server.load(\"bevy_logo.png\").unwrap().into()),\n        ..Default::default()\n    });\n\nInteraction Events\n#\n\nNodes with the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteraction\n\n component will track interaction state. You can easily build widgets like buttons this way:\n\nFor example, here is a system that only runs on Buttons where the Interaction state has changed:\nfn system(_button: &amp;Button, interaction: Mutated&lt;Interaction&gt;) {\n    match *interaction {\n        Interaction::Clicked =&gt; println!(\"clicked\"),\n        Interaction::Hovered =&gt; println!(\"hovered\"),\n        Interaction::None =&gt; {},\n    }\n}\n\n2D Features\n#\n\nSprites\n#\n\nYou can use any \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexture\n\n asset as a sprite directly:\n\nlet texture = asset_server.load(\"icon.png\").unwrap();\ncommands.spawn(SpriteComponents {\n    material: materials.add(texture.into()),\n    ..Default::default()\n});\n\nSprite Sheets\n#\n\nSprite sheets (also known as texture atlases) can be used for animations, tile sets, or just for optimized sprite rendering.\n\nlet texture_atlas = TextureAtlas::from_grid(texture_handle, texture.size, 7, 1);\nlet texture_atlas_handle = texture_atlases.add(texture_atlas);\ncommands\n    .spawn(SpriteSheetComponents {\n        texture_atlas: texture_atlas_handle,\n        sprite: TextureAtlasSprite::new(0),\n        ..Default::default()\n    });\n\nDynamic Texture Atlas Generation\n#\n\nSprites are often produced as individual files. Bevy can combine them into a single sprite sheet dynamically!\n\nfor sprite_handle in sprite_handles.iter() {\n    let texture = textures.get(&amp;handle).unwrap();\n    texture_atlas_builder.add_texture(handle, &amp;texture);\n}\n\nlet texture_atlas = texture_atlas_builder.finish(&amp;mut textures).unwrap();\n\n3D Features\n#\n\nGLTF Model Loading\n#\n\nLoad GLTF files as Mesh assets\n\ncommands\n    .spawn(PbrComponents {\n        // load the model\n        mesh: asset_server.load(\"boat.gltf\").unwrap(),\n        // create a material for the model\n        material: materials.add(asset_server.load(\"boat.png\").into()),\n        ..Default::default()\n    })\n\nNote: in the near future we will add support for loading GLTF files as Scenes instead of meshes.\nDepth Based Draw Order\n#\n\nFront-to-back drawing for fast \"early fragment discarding\" of opaque materials, and back-to-front drawing for correct transparent materials\n\nParenting\n#\n\nParent transforms are propagated to their descendants\n\ncommands\n    .spawn(PbrComponents {\n        mesh: cube_handle,\n        ..Default::default()\n    }).with_children(|parent| {\n        parent.spawn(PbrComponents {\n            mesh: cube_handle,\n            translation: Translation::new(0.0, 2.0, 0.0),\n            ..Default::default()\n        });\n    })\n\nMSAA\n#\n\nGet nice smooth edges by using Multi-Sample Anti-Aliasing\n\n\napp.add_resource(Msaa { samples: 8 })\n\nScenes\n#\n\nScenes are a way to compose pieces of your game/app ahead of time. In Bevy, Scenes are simply a collection of entities and components. A Scene can be \"spawned\" into a World any number of times. \"Spawning\" copies the Scene's entities and components into the given World.\nScenes can also be saved to and loaded from \"scene files\". One of the primary goals of the future \"Bevy Editor\" will be to make it easy to compose scene files visually.\nFile Format\n#\n\nScene files are a saved and loaded as a flat list of entities and components:\n[\n  (\n    entity: 328997855,\n    components: [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"Position\",\n        \"map\": { \"x\": 3.0, \"y\": 4.0 },\n      },\n    ],\n  ),\n  (\n    entity: 404566393,\n    components: [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"Position\",\n        \"map\": { \"x\": 1.0, \"y\": 2.0 },\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"Name\",\n        \"map\": { \"value\": \"Carter\" },\n      },\n    ],\n  ),\n]\n\nThe numbers assigned to the entity fields are entity's id, which are completely optional. If no entity id is provided, one will be randomly generated when the scene is loaded. We have plans to improve this format in the future to be more ergonomic, indent entity hierarchies, and support nested scenes.\nLoading and Instancing\n#\n\nScenes can be added to a World using the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSceneSpawner\n\n resource. Spawning can be done with either \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSceneSpawner::load()\n\n or \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSceneSpawner::instance()\n\n. \"Loading\" a Scene preserves the entity IDs in it. This is useful for something like a save file where you want entity ids to be constant and changes to be applied on top of entities already in the world. \"Instancing\" adds entities to the World with brand-new IDs, which allows multiple \"instances\" of a scene to exist in the same World.\nfn load_scene_system(asset_server: Res&lt;AssetServer&gt;, mut scene_spawner: ResMut&lt;SceneSpawner&gt;) {\n    // Scenes are loaded just like any other asset.\n    let scene: Handle&lt;Scene&gt; = asset_server.load(\"my_scene.scn\").unwrap();\n    // Spawns the scene with entity ids preserved\n    scene_spawner.load(scene);\n    // Spawns the scene with new entity ids\n    scene_spawner.instance(scene);\n}\n\nSaving ECS Worlds To Scenes\n#\n\nAny ECS World can be converted to a scene like this:\nlet scene = Scene::from_world(&amp;world, &amp;component_type_registry);\n\nYou can then convert the scene to a RON formatted string like this:\nlet ron_string = scene.serialize_ron(&amp;property_type_registry)?;\n\nHot Scene Reloading\n#\n\nChanges to Scene files can be automatically applied to spawned Scenes at runtime. This allows for immediate feedback without restarts or recompiles.\n\nNote that the video above is not sped up. Scene changes are effectively applied instantaneously.\nHow Does This Work?\n#\n\nScenes are built on top of Bevy's Property and Asset systems. Components can be used in scenes provided they derive the Properties trait. Properties are what enable scene serialization, deserialization, and patching changes at runtime. Check out the next section for more details.\nProperties\n#\n\nIn a nutshell, Bevy Properties add some dynamism to Rust, which is a notoriously static language. It is often useful to get or set a struct's field using a string version of its name, or interact with a struct when you don't have a statically typed reference. Languages generally cover these cases with \"reflection\" features, but unfortunately Rust does not currently have this type of reflection. I built the bevy_property crate to provide a subset of useful \"reflection-like\" features in Rust. Here is a quick surface-level introduction:\n#[derive(Properties)]\npub struct Counter {\n    count: u32,\n}\n\nlet mut counter = Counter { count: 1 };\n\n// You can set a property value like this. The type must match exactly or this will fail.\ncounter.set_prop_val::&lt;u32&gt;(\"count\", 2);\nassert_eq!(counter.count, 2);\nassert_eq!(counter.prop_val::&lt;u32&gt;(\"count\").unwrap(), 2);\n\n// You can also set properties dynamically. set_prop accepts any type that implements the Property trait, but the property type must match the field type or this operation will fail.\nlet new_count: u32 = 3;\ncounter.set_prop(\"count\", &amp;new_count);\nassert_eq!(counter.count, 3);\n\n// DynamicProperties also implements the Properties trait, but it has no restrictions on field names or types\nlet mut patch = DynamicProperties::map();\npatch.set_prop_val::&lt;usize&gt;(\"count\", 4);\n\n// You can \"apply\" Properties on top of other Properties. This will only set properties with the same name and type. You can use this to \"patch\" your properties with new values.\ncounter.apply(&amp;patch);\nassert_eq!(counter.count, 4);\n\n// Types that implement Properties can be converted to DynamicProperties\nlet dynamic_thing: DynamicProperties = counter.to_dynamic();\n\nProperties are what make Bevy's Scene system so nice to use. I also plan to use them for features in the upcoming Bevy Editor, such as undo/redo, viewing and editing component properties at runtime, and property animation tools.\nTypes that implement Properties can be serialized using serde and DynamicProperties can be deserialized using serde. When combined with the Properties patching feature, this means any type that derives Properties can be round trip serialized and deserialized.\nTo derive Properties each field in the struct must implement the Property trait. This is already implemented for most core Rust and Bevy types, so you should only need to implement Property for custom types (and you can derive Property too).\nI have a feeling that the bevy_property crate will be useful in non-Bevy contexts, so I'll be publishing it to crates.io in the near future.\nEvents\n#\n\nBevy uses a double-buffered event system that enables efficient event production and consumption with zero-allocation event consumers. Here is a complete Bevy app that produces and consumes a custom event:\nfn main() {\n    App::build()\n        .add_event::&lt;MyEvent&gt;()\n        .add_system(event_producer.system())\n        .add_system(event_consumer.system())\n        .run();\n}\n\nstruct MyEvent {\n    message: String,\n}\n\nfn event_producer(mut my_events: ResMut&lt;Events&lt;MyEvent&gt;&gt;) {\n    my_events.send(MyEvent { message: \"Hello\".to_string() });\n}\n\n#[derive(Default)]\nstruct State {\n    reader: EventReader&lt;MyEvent&gt;, \n}\n\nfn event_consumer(mut state: Local&lt;State&gt;, my_events: Res&lt;Events&lt;MyEvent&gt;&gt;) {\n    for event in state.reader.iter(&amp;my_events) {\n        println!(\"received message: {}\", event.message);\n    }\n}\n\napp.add_event::&lt;MyEvent&gt;() adds a new \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n resource for MyEvent and a system that swaps the Events&lt;MyEvent&gt; buffers every update.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEventReaders\n\n are very cheap to create. They are essentially just an array index that tracks the last event that has been read.\nEvents are used in Bevy for features like window resizing, assets, and input. The tradeoff for being both allocation and cpu efficient is that each system only has one chance to receive an event, otherwise it will be lost on the next update. I believe this is the correct tradeoff for apps that run in a loop (ex: games).\nAssets\n#\n\nBevy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssets\n\n are just typed data that can be referenced using asset \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHandles\n\n . For example, 3d meshes, textures, fonts, materials, scenes, and sounds are assets. Assets&lt;T&gt; is a generic collection of assets of type T. In general asset usage looks like this:\nAsset Creation\n#\n\nfn create_texture_system(mut textures: ResMut&lt;Assets&lt;Texture&gt;&gt;) {\n    // creates a new Texture asset and returns a handle, which can then be used to retrieve the actual asset\n    let texture_handle: Handle&lt;Texture&gt; = textures.add(Texture::default());\n}\n\nAsset Access\n#\n\nfn read_texture_system(textures: Res&lt;Assets&lt;Texture&gt;&gt;, texture_handle: &amp;Handle&lt;Texture&gt;) {\n    // retrieves a Texture using the current entity's Handle&lt;Texture&gt; component\n    let texture: &amp;Texture = textures.get(texture_handle).unwrap();\n}\n\nAsset Events\n#\n\nThe Assets&lt;T&gt; collection is basically just a map from Handle&lt;T&gt; to T that records created, modified, and removed Events. These events can also be consumed as a system resource, just like any other Events:\nfn system(mut state: Local&lt;State&gt;, texture_events: Res&lt;Events&lt;AssetEvent&gt;&gt;) {\n    for event in state.reader.iter(&amp;texture_events) {\n        if let AssetEvent::Created { handle } = event {\n            /* do something with created asset */\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nAsset Server\n#\n\nThe Assets&lt;T&gt; collection doesn't know anything about filesystems or multi-threading. This is the responsibility of the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssetServer\n\n resource:\nfn system(mut commands: Commands, asset_server: Res&lt;AssetServer&gt;, mut textures: ResMut&lt;Assets&lt;Texture&gt;&gt;) {\n    // this will begin asynchronously loading \"texture.png\" in parallel \n    let texture_handle: Handle&lt;Texture&gt; = asset_server.load(\"texture.png\").unwrap();\n\n    // the texture may not be loaded yet, but you can still add the handle as a component immediately.\n    // whenever possible, internal Bevy systems will wait for assets to be ready before using them:\n    let entity = commands.spawn((texture_handle,));\n\n    // you can also asynchronously load entire folders (recursively) by adding them as an \"asset folder\"\n    asset_server.load_asset_folder(\"assets\").unwrap();\n\n    // you can get the handle of any asset (either currently loading or loaded) like this:\n    let music_handle: Handle&lt;AudioSource&gt; = asset_server.get_handle(\"assets/music.mp3\").unwrap(); \n\n    // when assets have finished loading, they are automatically added to the appropriate Assets&lt;T&gt; collection\n    // you can check if an asset is ready like this:\n    if let Some(texture) = textures.get(&amp;texture_handle) {\n        // do something with texture\n    }\n\n    // sometimes you want access to an asset immediately. you can block the current system until an asset has\n    // finished loading and immediately update Assets&lt;T&gt; using the \"load_sync\" method\n    let cool_sprite: &amp;Texture =  asset_server.load_sync(&amp;mut textures, \"assets/cool_sprite.png\").unwrap();\n}\n\nHot Reloading\n#\n\nYou can enable asset change detection by calling:\nasset_server.watch_for_changes().unwrap();\n\nThis will load new versions of assets whenever their files have changed.\nAdding New Asset Types\n#\n\nTo add a new asset type, implement the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssetLoader\n\n trait. This tells Bevy what file formats to look for and how to translate the file bytes into the given asset type.\nOnce you have implemented AssetLoader&lt;MyAsset&gt; for MyAssetLoader you can register your new loader like this:\napp.add_asset_loader::&lt;MyAsset, MyAssetLoader&gt;();\n\nThen you can access the Assets&lt;MyAsset&gt; resource, listen for change events, and call asset_server.load(\"something.my_asset\")\nSound\n#\n\nYou can currently load and play sounds like this:\nfn system(asset_server: Res&lt;AssetServer&gt;, audio_output: Res&lt;AudioOutput&gt;) {\n    let music: Handle&lt;AudioSource&gt; = asset_server.load(\"music.mp3\").unwrap(); \n\n    // this will play the music asynchronously as soon as it has loaded\n    audio_output.play(music);\n\n    // if you already have an AudioSource reference you can play it immediately like this:\n    audio_output.play_source(audio_source);\n}\n\nWe plan on extending the audio system with more control and features in the future.\nRender Graph\n#\n\nAll render logic is built on top of Bevy's \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRenderGraph\n\n. The Render Graph is a way to encode atomic units of render logic. For example, you might create graph nodes for a 2D pass, UI pass, cameras, texture copies, swap chains, etc. Connecting a node to another node indicates that there is a dependency of some kind between them. By encoding render logic this way, the Bevy renderer is able to analyze dependencies and render the graph in parallel. It also has the benefit of encouraging developers to write modular render logic.\nBevy includes a number of nodes by default: CameraNode, PassNode, RenderResourcesNode, SharedBuffersNode, TextureCopyNode, WindowSwapChainNode, and WindowTextureNode. It also provides subgraphs for 2d rendering, 3d rendering, and UI rendering. But you are welcome to create your own nodes, your own graphs, or extend the included graphs!\nData Driven Shaders\n#\n\nComponents and Assets can derive the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRenderResources\n\n trait, which enables them to be directly copied to GPU resources and used as shader uniforms.\nBinding uniforms to a custom shader is literally as simple as deriving RenderResources on your component or asset:\n#[derive(RenderResources, Default)]\nstruct MyMaterial {\n    pub color: Color,\n}\n\nAnd then adding a new RenderResourceNode to the Render Graph:\n// create the new node\nrender_graph.add_system_node(\"my_material\", RenderResourcesNode::&lt;MyMaterial&gt;::new(true));\n\n// connect the new node to the \"main pass node\"\nrender_graph.add_node_edge(\"my_material\", base::node::MAIN_PASS).unwrap();\n\nFrom there, MyMaterial components will be automatically copied to GPU buffers. A shader can then reference an entity's MyMaterial like this:\nlayout(set = 1, binding = 1) uniform MyMaterial_color {\n    vec4 color;\n};\n\nI think the simplicity of the fully self-contained custom shader example speaks for itself.\nShader Defs\n#\n\nComponents and Assets can also add \"shader defs\" to selectively enable shader code on a per-entity basis:\n#[derive(RenderResources, ShaderDefs, Default)]\nstruct MyMaterial {\n    pub color: Color,\n    #[render_resource(ignore)]\n    #[shader_def]\n    pub always_blue: bool,\n}\n\nThen in your fragment shader you could do something like this:\nvoid main() {\n    o_Target = color;\n# ifdef MYMATERIAL_ALWAYS_BLUE\n    o_Target = vec4(0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0);\n# endif\n}\n\nAny entity with a MyMaterial component and always_blue: true will be rendered blue. If always_blue is false, it will be rendered with color.\nWe currently use this feature for toggling \"shadeless\" rendering and optional textures, but I anticipate it being useful in a variety of contexts.\nShader Layout Reflection\n#\n\nBevy can automatically reflect shader data layouts from SpirV shaders (and from GLSL shaders by compiling them to SpirV). This means that creating custom shaders is as simple as this:\nlet shader_stages = ShaderStages {\n    vertex: shaders.add(Shader::from_glsl(ShaderStage::Vertex, VERTEX_SHADER)),\n    fragment: Some(shaders.add(Shader::from_glsl(ShaderStage::Fragment, FRAGMENT_SHADER))),\n};\nlet pipeline_handle = pipelines.add(PipelineDescriptor::default_config(shader_stages));\n\nProductive Compile Times\n#\n\nOne of my primary design goals for Bevy is \"productivity\". Game development is an extremely iterative and experimental process full of small changes. If each change takes a significant amount of time to test, then development becomes a grind. Here is my personal \"acceptability scale\" for iterative changes:\n\n0-1 seconds: ideal\n1-3 seconds: fine\n3-5 seconds: annoying\n5-10 seconds: painful but still usable if you are committed\n10+ seconds: completely unusable\n\nNote that these are \"iterative compile times\" not \"clean compile times\". Clean compiles only need to happen once, whereas iterative compiles happen constantly. I care a lot less about the \"clean compile\" metric when it comes to productivity, although it is still important to keep clean compile times down for other reasons.\nOne of the most popular Rust engines today takes over 30 seconds to compile a single newline inserted into trivial examples. That is categorically unproductive and makes real game-dev practically impossible.\nCurrently, with the \"fast compiles\" configuration, changes to Bevy examples can be compiled in ~0.8-3 seconds, based on your computer specs, configuration, and OS choice (more on this later). There is of course always room for improvement here, but Bevy currently falls into my \"usability sweet spot\".\nThe \"Rust compiles slow\" meme exists largely because many Rust projects aren't thinking enough about the compile time performance implications of certain code patterns. Rust code generally compiles slowly for three reasons:\n\nGeneric Monomorphization: The compile step where generic code gets turned into a non-generic copy. Compile times go up as the volume of monomorphized code goes up. To keep costs low you should either avoid generics entirely or keep generic code \"small\" and shallow.\nLink Time: How long it takes to link code. Here the important thing is to keep code volume and dependency counts low.\nLLVM: Rust throws a large amounts of IR code at LLVM and expects it to optimize it. This takes time. Additionally LLVM is optimized for \"fast code at runtime\" more than \"fast code generation\".\n\nThe LLVM bit is out of our hands (for now). Keeping generic usage low and shallow isn't a particularly hard problem, provided you employ that mindset from the beginning. Link times, on the other hand, are a constant and very real \"enemy\" of iterative compile times. Linking happens on every iterative compile. Adding any code to your project will increase link times. Adding any dependency to your project will increase link times.\nThe cards are stacked against us for a variety of reasons:\n\nThe Game Engine Domain\n\nGame engines inherently touch a large number of domains (and therefore involve a large number of dependencies)\nGame engines are \"big\" ... they require a lot of code\n\n\nRust's Design Choices\n\nDependencies are statically linked by default, which means every new dependency adds link times\nRust's default linker is quite slow\nCargo makes taking dependencies very easy. What appears to be a small, simple crate might actually have a large dependency tree\n\n\n\nOne solution to this problem is to avoid dependencies at all costs and write the smallest amount of code that you can. The Macroquad project is a great example of this. They employ a minimalist approach to code and avoid any dependency that doesn't meet their strict compile time requirements. As a result, I think its fair to say that they are the fastest compiling (while still usable) Rust game engine, both for clean and iterative compiles. However their approach comes at the cost of dependency aversion.\nBevy takes a slightly more pragmatic approach. First, being willing to take dependencies is good for the Rust ecosystem. I don't want to ignore all of the great work that has already been done, especially when it comes to projects like winit and wgpu. But we still strive to keep our dependency tree as small as we can. And any dependency that takes Bevy out of the \"ideal to fine\" iterative compile time range must either be pared down or removed. When combined with the \"Fast Compiles\" configuration, this results in nice compile times.\nThe \"Fast Compiles\" Configuration\n#\n\nThe \"fast compiles\" configuration is how we achieve usable iterative compile times while still taking dependencies. It consists of three parts:\n\nLLD linker: LLD is much faster at linking than the default Rust linker. This is the biggest win.\nNightly Rust Compiler: Gives access to the latest performance improvements and \"unstable\" optimizations. Note that Bevy can still be compiled on stable Rust if that is a requirement for you.\nGeneric Sharing: Allows crates to share monomorphized generic code instead of duplicating it. In some cases this allows us to \"precompile\" generic code so it doesn't affect iterative compiles.\n\nTo enable fast compiles, install the nightly rust compiler and LLD. Then copy this file to YOUR_WORKSPACE/.cargo/config\nCurrent Limitations and Future Improvements\n#\n\nWhile Bevy is currently \"productive\" by my criteria, it isn't all sunshine and rainbows yet. First, MacOS doesn't have an up-to-date version of the LLD linker and therefore iterative compiles are much slower on that platform. Additionally, LLD is slightly slower on Windows than it is on Linux. On my machine I get ~1.5-3.0 seconds on Windows vs ~0.8-3.0 seconds on Linux.\nDynamic Linking to the Rescue\n#\n\nAn easy way to cut down on link times is to just dynamically link instead. On my 2013 MacBook Pro running MacOS (with no LLD), I was able to drop iterative Bevy compile times from ~6 seconds to ~0.6 seconds by dynamically linking app plugins. Bevy actually already has support for dynamic App plugins, but the new Bevy ECS does not currently support dynamic linking because it relies on TypeIds (which are incompatible with dynamic linking). Fortunately, I have already solved the TypeId problem in other projects, so we should be able to add this back soon.\nCranelift Rustc Backend\n#\n\nCranelift is an alternative compiler backend that is optimized for fast compiles. The rustc cranelift backend is rapidly approaching a usable state. I'm hoping it will give us a nice boost eventually.\nExample Game: Breakout\n#\n\nIf you are curious about what actual Bevy game code looks like, check out the breakout example. Forgive my slightly janky collision code please :)\n\nWhy Build Bevy?\n#\n\nThere are plenty of fantastic engines out there ... why build another one? Especially when there are already so many in the Rust ecosystem?\nFirst a bit about me: I decided to build Bevy after years of contributing code to other engines (ex: Godot). I spent over four years building a game in Godot and I also have experience with Unity, Unreal, and a number of other frameworks like SDL and Three.js. I have built multiple custom engines in the past using Rust, Go, HTML5, and Java. I have also used and/or closely followed most of the current players in the Rust gamedev ecosystem. I recently quit my job as Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft and my experience there deeply affected my opinions of software and what it should be.\nThese experiences led me to want the following from a game engine:\n\nFree and Open Source: It needs to be free and open source with no strings attached. Games are a huge part of our culture and humanity is investing millions of hours into the development of games. Why are we (as game developers / engine developers) continuing to build up the ecosystems of closed-source monopolies that take cuts of our sales and deny us visibility into the tech we use daily? As a community I believe we can do so much better. This criteria eliminates Unreal and Unity, despite their huge feature sets.\nProductive: It needs to have fast build/run/test loops, which translates to either scripting languages or fast compile times in native languages. But scripting languages introduce runtime overhead, cognitive load, and a barrier between me and the actual engine, so my preference here is a native language with fast compile times. Sadly compile times are a huge problem in the Rust ecosystem and many Rust engines have prohibitively long iterative compiles. Fortunately Rust game engines like Macroquad and coffee prove that productive iterative compile times are possible.\nTurtles All The Way Down: Ideally the engine is written in the same language that games are. Being able to run an IDE \"go to definition\" command on a symbol in your game and hop directly into the engine source is an extremely powerful concept. You also don't need to worry about heavy language translation layers or lossy abstractions. If an engine's community builds games in the same language as the engine, they are more likely (and able) to contribute back to the engine.\nSimple: It needs to be easy to use for common tasks, but it also can't hide the details from you. Many engines are either \"easy to use but too high level\" or \"very low level but difficult to do common tasks in\". Additionally, many engines in Rust are littered with lifetimes and generics. Both are powerful tools to be sure, but they also introduce cognitive load and reduce ergonomics. Generics can also have a huge impact on compile times if you aren't careful.\nEditor: It needs to have an (optional) graphical editor. Scene creation is a large part of game development and in many cases visual editors beat code. As a bonus, the editor should be built in the engine. Godot uses this approach and it is so smart. Doing so dogfoods the engine's UI system and creates positive feedback loops. Improvements to the editor are also often improvements to the core engine. It also makes sure your engine is flexible enough to build tooling (and not just games). I personally consider building an engine's editor in another stack to be a missed opportunity (ex: the web, QT, native widgets).\nData Driven: It needs to be data-driven/data-oriented/data-first. ECS is a common way of doing this, but it definitely isn't the only way. These paradigms can make your game faster (cache friendly, easier to parallelize), but they also make common tasks like game state serialization and synchronization delightfully straightforward.\n\nNone of the engines on the market quite line up with what I'm looking for. And the changes required to make them meet my requirements are either massive in scope, impossible (closed source), or unwelcome (the things I want aren't what the developers or customers want). On top of that, making new game engines is fun!\nBevy is not trying to out-compete other open-source game engines. As much as possible we should be collaborating and building common foundations. If you are an open source game engine developer and you think a Bevy component would make your engine better, one of your engine's components could make Bevy better, or both, please reach out! Bevy is already benefitting massively from the efforts of the Rust gamedev ecosystem and we would love to pay it forward in whatever way we can.\nWhat's Next?\n#\n\nI'm proud of how far Bevy has come in a relatively short period of time, but there is still plenty of work left to do. These will be our focus areas over the coming months:\nPhysically Based Rendering (PBR)\n#\n\nBevy's current 3D renderer is extremely bare bones. As I primarily make 3D games, improving the 3D renderer is a priority for me. We will be adding PBR shaders, shadows, more lighting options, skeletal animation, improved GLTF import, ambient occlusion (implementation TBD), and probably a bunch of other things.\nEditor\n#\n\nBevy was architected with a visual editor in mind. The Scene and Properties systems were specifically built to make game&lt;-&gt;editor dataflow nicer. The editor will be built as a Bevy App and will utilize the existing Bevy UI, Bevy ECS, Scene, and Properties features. I like the \"build the editor in the engine\" approach because improvements to the editor are often improvements to the engine, and vice-versa. Additionally, it ensures that Bevy is capable of building non-game apps and tooling.\nPlatform Support: Android, iOS, Web\n#\n\nUnder the hood Bevy uses winit (for multi-platform windows and input) and wgpu (for multi-platform rendering). Each of these projects has varying degrees of support for the platforms above. And in general Bevy was designed to be platform-agnostic, so supporting the platforms above should be possible with a little bit of work.\nRender Batching and Instancing\n#\n\nRight now Bevy can render plenty fast for most use cases, but when it comes to rendering huge amounts of objects (tens of thousands) it isn't quite there yet. To accomplish that, we need to implement batching / instancing. These concepts can be defined in a number of ways, but the general gist is that we will be grouping as much geometry and data into the smallest number of draw calls possible, while also reducing GPU state changes as much as possible. I'm hoping Bevy's data driven shader approach will make the instancing implementation simple and extensible.\nCanvas\n#\n\nRight now the only way to draw UI and 2D scenes is via sprites and rectangles. Bevy needs an immediate-mode drawing api capable of drawing anti-aliased curves and shapes. This can then be used to do code-driven drawing of things like rounded corners in Bevy UI, performance graphs in the editor, etc. It's very possible that we will integrate projects like pathfinder or lyon for this.\nAnimation\n#\n\nAnimation permeates almost everything in gamedev. First, I want to add a general purpose code-first animation system. Then on top of that we will add a property-based timeline system that can be saved to a config file and visualized / edited in the Bevy Editor.\nNicer Scene Format\n#\n\nThe current scene format is workable, but it isn't yet ideal for manual scene composition because it is a flat list of unordered entities. I also want to add nested scenes. Eventually, I would like the scene format to look something like this.\nDynamic Plugin Loading\n#\n\nTo mitigate the cost of compiling and linking plugins and make hot-code-reloading possible, we will provide the option to dynamically load App plugins. Bevy actually already supports this feature, but there is one hangup: Rust's TypeId. TypeIds are unstable across binaries, which means TypeId::of::&lt;T&gt;() in the host binary will not match TypeId::of::&lt;T&gt;() in a dynamically loaded binary. Bevy ECS uses TypeIds, which means dynamically loaded ECS types won't behave correctly. In the past, Bevy used a custom fork of the Legion ECS (where we fixed the TypeId problem). But since moving to Bevy ECS the problem has resurfaced. The fix is to apply the same approach we used in Legion to Bevy ECS.\nPhysics\n#\n\nMany games require collision detection and physics. I'm planning on building a plug-able physics interface with nphysics / ncollide as the first backend.\nPolish\n#\n\nThere are plenty of areas that need more design work or features. For example, I think the core Render Graph is in a pretty good state, but the mid-level and high level rendering APIs need more time and experimentation. I also want to rethink how materials are composed. If you are curious about all of the improvements on our radar, check out the Bevy issue tracker on GitHub.\nDocumentation\n#\n\nBevy's APIs are still very unstable, so I haven't spent much time documenting anything yet. The Bevy Book is still small and the Rust API Docs have plenty of gaps. In general I subscribe to the idea of \"documentation proportional to stability\". As features stabilize and design patterns emerge, we will increase efforts in both of those areas.\nJoin the Bevy!\n#\n\nIf any of this sounds interesting to you, I encourage you to check out Bevy on GitHub, read The Bevy Book, and join the Bevy community.

Join the Bevy!\n\n","id":"https://bevyengine.org/news/introducing-bevy/","title":"Introducing Bevy 0.1"},"https://bevyengine.org/news/scaling-bevy-development/":{"body":"The Bevy community has grown a lot over the past couple of years. We've had over 3,642 pull requests, 599 contributors, 357,917 downloads, and 21,200 github stars. Together we've built the most popular, most used Rust game engine on the market and the second most popular game engine on GitHub. Up until now, in the interest of maintaining a consistent vision and quality bar, I've kept our decision making process as small and centralized as possible. And I scaled out our leadership roles as slowly as possible. I believe this was the right call for Bevy's early days, but we are overdue for changes that bias toward more trust and development agility.\nThe Current State Of Things\n#\n\nI have been slowly delegating responsibility over time, and each time I placed trust in someone it yielded massive benefits to both the project and my personal well being. We now have 3 more fantastic Maintainers: Alice (@alice-i-cecile), François (@mockersf), and Rob (@superdump). And their scope has grown over time.\nBut even today, I must personally approve every \"controversial\" change to Bevy, where \"controversial\" is basically anything that meaningfully expands our features, user experience, or scope. With the volume of controversial changes we're seeing now, and the number of things I would still like to personally design and build, this is untenable. I have long since reached the limits of my bandwidth and the community has felt those limits for long enough.\nWhen Bevy was younger and the community was newer, this level of conservativeness made sense. I knew what I wanted to build, how the pieces fit together, and what my capabilities were. What I didn't know as well was what everyone else wanted to build, what their capabilities were, and how that all fit into my personal vision.\nI can now happily report that the situation has changed. We have proven technical experts in a variety of areas. They regularly design and build huge pieces of Bevy in a way that aligns with our collective vision for the future. Sometimes we have different ideas about what the future should look like, but we almost always reach consensus eventually. They have done outstanding technical work, built trust, and made Bevy amazing. They deserve a seat at the table.\nWith that preamble out of the way, I am excited to announce two major changes to the Bevy Organization.\nA New Role: Subject Matter Expert\n#\n\nSubject Matter Experts (SME for short) are Bevy developers that have consistently demonstrated technical expertise and synchronized vision within a given \"subject area\" (ex: Rendering, ECS, Reflection, Animation). They must have contributed and reviewed significant pieces of Bevy within their area. These people have the ability to vote on controversial pull requests in their subject area (both code changes and RFCs). SMEs are also great people to reach out to if you have questions about a given subject area in Bevy.\nIf two SMEs within a given subject area approve a \"controversial\" PR, a maintainer can now merge it. We are intentionally keeping the number of SMEs within a subject area small to make establishing consensus and enforcing a consistent vision easier. For now, 2 SMEs is the bare minimum to allow voting to occur, 3 is the \"sweet spot\", and 4 will be allowed under some circumstances, but is the \"upper limit\".\nAs Project Lead, I can still merge controversial PRs. Consider 2 SME approvals as equivalent to a Project Lead approval. As a last line of defense for cohesion, the Project Lead maintains final say on changes. While I will by default defer to the SMEs, if they approve a PR that I firmly believe is the wrong direction for Bevy, I will still block or revert the change. Preserving consistent vision and quality is critically important to me. But I intend to bias toward trust and consensus as much as possible.\nIt is the job of SMEs to strive for consensus amongst themselves, the wider Bevy community, and Project Leads. They can merge controversial changes without me, but they still must do their best to anticipate my reaction to those changes (and discuss the changes with me ahead of time when that feels relevant). Likewise, I will try to establish consensus with SMEs and the wider community before making changes myself.\nWe are rolling out SMEs slowly so we can tweak the process over time and avoid changing too much too quickly. We've largely started with subject areas that have the most activity and the clearest subject matter experts. Join me in welcoming our initial set of SMEs!\n\nRendering: @superdump (Rob Swain), @robtfm (Rob Macdonald)\nECS: @BoxyUwU (Boxy), @james7132 (James Liu), @maniwani (Joy)\nReflection: @MrGVSV (Gino Valente), @jakobhellermann (Jakob Hellermann)\nAnimation: @james7132 (James Liu), @mockersf (François Mockers)\n\nHopefully there aren't too many surprises here. These people have been building fantastic things in their areas for a long time now.\nWe will be rolling out more subject areas (and the SMEs inside them) as SMEs prove themselves within the Bevy project and express interest. New areas are largely defined by the experts doing work inside them. We expect areas like UI, Editor, and Audio to be populated in reasonably short order.\nWe have also left spots open in each of the subject areas above. If you believe you meet our SME criteria for any current or proposed subject area and have interest in the role, don't hesitate to reach out to myself or any of the other maintainers. We will consider new candidates regularly. Just because you weren't included in this first batch doesn't mean we don't think you would be a good fit!\nA New Maintainer\n#\n\nWe also want to improve our velocity for merging uncontroversial pull requests. And there will be new maintainership load associated with facilitating the SME process. The current maintainers and I have unanimously agreed that it is time to bring on one more maintainer.\nJoin me in welcoming James Liu (@james7132) as our latest maintainer! James has proven themselves to be a technical expert across many of Bevy's systems (especially ECS, animation, parallelization / task scheduling, and optimization). You may have noticed that they also have the SME role for ECS and Animation. They have contributed huge volumes of code changes, provided solid reviews, are easy to work with, and have a vision for Bevy's future that aligns with ours.\nA New Bevy Organization Document\n#\n\nWe have a new Bevy Organization Document, which describes how the Bevy Organization will work going forward. It outlines the functionality of each role, as well as the expectations we have for them. The previously existing roles (Project Lead, Maintainer) still work the same way, but their definition and scope have been made much clearer.\nThe biggest changes to the organization are the new SME role and an initial description of \"role rotation\":\nRoles like Project Lead, Maintainer, and SME are intentionally kept in limited supply to ensure a cohesive project vision. However these roles can be taxing, sometimes other aspects of life need to take priority, and qualified motivated people deserve a chance to lead. To resolve these issues, we plan on building in \"role rotation\". What this looks like hasn't yet been determined (as this issue hasn't come up yet and we are still in the process of scaling out our team), but we will try to appropriately balance the needs and desires of both current and future leaders, while also ensuring consistent vision and continuity for Bevy.\nThe Bevy People Page\n#\n\nBevy is a community-driven project. It makes sense for the people behind Bevy and the roles they fill to be easily discoverable.\nTo make that happen, François (@mockersf) and I built a new Bevy People page. \"Bevy people\" can opt-in to listing their name and/or pseudonym, their social information (GitHub, Discord, Mastodon, Twitter, personal website, itch.io, etc), a sponsorship link, and a personal bio describing who they are and what they work on.\nIt also displays the current Bevy Organization roles these people occupy. You could call it an \"org chart\" if you wanted to, but my anti-bureaucracy reflexes prevent me from doing so. The Bevy community will always be as flat and \"people first\" as possible.\nIt is open to anyone (both Bevy Organization members and the wider Bevy community). If you would like to see yourself on this page, create a pull request here.\nThis is what it looks like!\n\nLooking Forward\n#\n\nThe next Bevy release (Bevy 0.10) is roughly a month away and I'm very excited for the changes we have in the pipeline. I can't guarantee all of these will make it in, but they're all shaping up nicely:\n\nThe New \"Stageless\" ECS Scheduler: We've fully rebuilt our scheduler to be more flexible. We no longer need \"stages\" to handle \"exclusive system scheduling\". Any system of any type can be ordered relative to any other system (even if they have exclusive access to the ECS World. Many scheduling APIs are now cleaner and easier to use. And we've taken the chance to improve related APIs like States as well.\nDepth and Normal Prepass: This will give rendering feature developers access to the depth buffer and normals during the main render phase, which enables a variety of render features and optimizations.\nScreen Space Ambient Occlusion: This is a popular, relatively cheap illumination technique that can make scenes look much more natural. It builds on the Depth Prepass work.\nAsset Preprocessing: We're reworking our asset system to allow for pre processing assets into more efficient forms, which can make deployed games faster to load, prettier, and faster. This is a full asset system rework that improves a good portion of our asset APIs.\nWindows as Entities: Windows are now ECS Entities instead of Resources, which makes them more natural to construct and query, more extensible, and opens the doors to including them in Bevy Scenes.\nUI Style Split: Breaks the monolithic UI style type out into smaller pieces, embracing a less centralized and more extensible pattern.\n\nSee you in about a month!\n","id":"https://bevyengine.org/news/scaling-bevy-development/","title":"Scaling Bevy Development"},"https://bevyengine.org/news/scaling-bevy/":{"body":"First, I want to take a moment to highlight just how wild the last week has been. Bevy was only released a week ago and we've already hit some pretty major milestones:\n\n    \n         3rd most popular /r/rust post of all time\n        \n    \n    \n        #2 on Hacker News\n        \n    \n    \n        2,200 Github Stars\n        \n    \n    \n        26 contributors\n        \n    \n    \n        644 Discord Users\n        \n    \n    \n        37% of the way to making my full time Bevy development sustainable\n        \n    \n    \n        A truly awesome number of community-developed plugins, games, and apps\n        \n    \n\nHow can Bevy operate at this scale?\n#\n\nI didn't in my wildest dreams anticipate a community to show up so quickly and in such force. Clearly the Bevy project resonates with people! This is wonderful, but it also presents some interesting challenges that I thought I would have a lot more time to solve:\n\nI am a bottleneck: Right now I am the only one with the right to merge code. This can't change until people get ramped up and trust is built.\nEveryone is fresh: Everyone is new to the codebase, so changes require a lot of scrutiny, and developers need a lot of guidance.\nNo structure: We don't have an organization or a well-defined development process.\n\nBefore we try to solve these problems, I think we need to ask ourselves:\nWhat made Bevy \"good\"?\n#\n\nI think this is actually a relatively straightforward answer. I think it boils down to:\n\nLearn from the best: I thoroughly reviewed at all of the existing options, learned all I could from them, and either built something new based on those learnings or made iterative improvements\nFreedom to experiment: I was unencumbered by stability guarantees, pressure to make the \"right\" call every time, or deadlines\nFocus: I was able to work on Bevy full time with zero distractions for ~5 months\n\nHow can we replicate this process at the new scale of the Bevy community? And how can I personally replicate this now that my job title has changed from \"solo incognito moonshot project architect\" to \"lead architect\" / \"project manager\" / \"community manager\" of a project with a developer community numbering in the thousands?\nThe Plan\n#\n\nI don't think now is the time to get bogged down in complex organizational structures or RFC processes. Eventually we will need those tools, but I don't think we're there yet. Instead I'm going to try to re-create the conditions I've been operating under for the last five months:\nBDFALAICMI\n#\n\nI plan on being a Benevolent Dictator For As Long As I Can Manage It. I will personally review every PR that gets merged and every design decision made. Eventually (if we do this right) that will become impossible, but we aren’t there yet. As I build trust in contributors and the project expands I will eventually start delegating. But I will always bias toward “small and focused”. My general skill-set and preference is to be a full time software developer / architect, but I have accepted that I need to balance that with being a project and community manager. My short term goal will be to drive down our massive Issue and PR backlog :)\nFocus Focus Focus\n#\n\nWe have a long road ahead of us. Building an engine is a lot like leveling up a skill tree in a game. Some features can't (or shouldn't) be built until we have built their predecessors. An example of this is the Bevy Editor. Before we break ground on the editor, we need to make sure Bevy UI and Bevy Scenes are in a good spot. I am just one person. I have limited bandwidth to build designs and review proposals, so I can't afford to waste energy on the editor yet.\nAt a given point in time, Bevy will have 3 focus areas. These areas will receive priority for my time, and I will try my best to direct contributors to those areas. This doesn't mean others aren't free to explore other areas they are interested in. Just don't expect to get them merged quickly. Ideally you're building a standalone plugin that doesn't require being directly merged into the Bevy repo anyway.\nFast and Loose\n#\n\nI don't want to get stuck in \"design hell\". We can debate the best way to build a PBR renderer for years. But without implementations and hard data, it is very hard to determine what is actually best in practice. I want to see code. Production-readiness is a non-feature. A good idea is nice, but if there is no implementation it isn't real to me. We need capable people to take good ideas and make them real. The faster we can try different approaches, the better. For now the general process will be:\n\nIdentify a focus area and communicate the general direction Bevy should be taking in this area\nEncourage contributors to create their own \"prototype\" crates. In some cases I will create my own. The Bevy project will provide a centralized list of these crates, which will facilitate discover-ability and help consolidate efforts. If you make a crate, please use the bevy_prototype_XXX format for crate names to respect the bevy_XXX namespace. This approach will allow us to \"scale out\" without too much process or centralization.\nOnce we have working prototypes we can start to try building consensus. We can afford to take our time here. The prototype features will already be out there for the people that want them. The cost of merging something too early is high. Merging something is a signal that we have picked a path and are committed to it. At that point experimentation becomes costly and painful for Bevy crate consumers. For now I will have the final say on what gets merged and when it happens. It will be the job of the community to convince me to take a given path, but I promise I'm reasonable! And I will defer to subject matter experts when it makes sense.\n\nCollaborate\n#\n\nBevy has caught the attention of many popular Rust projects. We are currently discussing the best way to collaborate with Amethyst Engine. I'm also talking to a number of other Rust project leads about the best way to make Bevy a good ecosystem player. As much as possible we should be building up common foundations. Please reach out to me (Twitter DMs or on Discord) if you know of potential collaboration areas.\nBevy's Current Focus Areas\n#\n\nHere are Bevy's current focus areas. I will direct my attention and attempt to direct everyone elses' attention to them. There are no deadlines. We will take as long as we need to get them right. I will work as hard as I can (full-time) to ensure we make quick progress on them:\nEditor-Ready UI\n#\n\nBefore we can start work on the Bevy Editor, we need a solid UI implementation. Bevy UI already has nice \"flexbox\" layout, and we already have a first stab at buttons and interaction events. But Bevy UI still needs a lot more experimentation if we're going to find the \"right\" patterns and paradigms. Editor-Ready UI has the following requirements:\n\nEmbraces the Bevy architecture: Bevy ECS, Bevy Scenes, Bevy Assets, Bevy Events\nA Canvas-style API for drawing widgets with shapes and anti-aliased curves\nDefine a consistent way to implement widgets\nA core set of widgets: buttons, inputs, resizable panels, etc\nTheme-ability\n\"Interaction\" and \"focus\" events\nTranslation-friendly. We can't be anglo-centric here\n\nSuggesting other UI frameworks or stacks is out of scope. The Bevy Editor will be built on top of Bevy UI. See the Introducing Bevy blog post for my rationale.\nPhysically Based Rendering (PBR)\n#\n\nPBR is a standard-ish way of rendering realistically in 3D. There is both a lot of interest and a lot of brain-power in this area, so it makes sense to build PBR now. This focus area has the following (minimum) requirements:\n\nPBR Shaders (which implies hdr)\nBloom (to convey hdr)\nShadowing (forces us to build out a real \"pipeline\")\nBattle-test the current mid-level rendering abstractions and rework them where necessary\n\nScenes\n#\n\nBevy Scenes currently do most of what we want, but they need a bit more work before they can be the foundation of Bevy state management. This focus area is also a requirement for the Bevy Editor.\n\nAsset Management: Inline assets, asset dependencies, stable ids when loaded from the disk\nBetter Scene Format: Improve the legibility and ergonomics of scene files to make them easy to read and easy to compose by hand. We're shooting for something close to this.\nEnabling/Disabling Systems: Scenes should be able to toggle their required systems on and off when they are added / removed\n\nWant to help?\n#\n\nIf you want to hop on this wild ride with us, here are a few ways you can help:\n\nContribute To Prototype Plugins: Start building new prototype Bevy plugins and contribute to the one's others are working on. Ideally in the focus areas above. At this point we are looking for fast prototypes that demonstrate new ideas. If you want to get started on a project within a given focus area:\n\nRead through the corresponding focus-area issue on GitHub\nLook for current projects in that issue and find potential collaboration areas.\nIf you can't find an existing project and you want to start one, set up a new crate/repo and link to it in the \"focus-area\" issue. We will maintain an index of active projects at the top of the thread. We will also encourage collaboration when it looks like there are overly-redundant efforts.\n\n\nAssist the Bevy Community: If you are able, help us resolve issues on the Bevy Issue Tracker, review pull requests, and provide help on the #help channel of our Discord. It is a real challenge to keep up with the sheer volume of work here, so any help is very very appreciated.\nHelp Me Make Full Time Development Sustainable: I need your help to make Bevy development sustainable! Five months ago I quit my comfortable Senior Software Engineer job at Microsoft to work on Bevy full time. I am currently paying my rent and living expenses out of pocket. I can't sustain this for long, as much as I want to. We're already 37% of the way to sustainable development and it has only been two days!\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing you in the Bevy Community!\n","id":"https://bevyengine.org/news/scaling-bevy/","title":"Scaling
